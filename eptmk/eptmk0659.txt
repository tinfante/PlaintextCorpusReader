Reduction of enzyme levels by propranolol after acute myocardial infarction.
The effect of propranolol (0.1 mg/kg intravenously followed by 320 mg given over 27 hour orally) on serum levels of creatine kinase enzyme was studied in a randomized trial involving 95 patients seen within 12 hours of onset of symptoms of uncomplicated myocardial infarction. In 15 patients who were treated with propranolol within 4 hours of onset, and who eventually developed pathological Q waves, peak measured enzyme levels were 27% (P less than 0.0125) lower than in 19 control patients who were also seen within 4 hours of the onset but had no specific treatment. Total calculated enzyme appearance was also lower in the treated patients (reduced 25%, P less than 0.05) as was the calculated rate of the appearance (33%, P less than 0.005). No significant difference was found for treated compared with control patients entering the trial more than 4 hours after the onset of chest pain. This evidence suggests that propranolol may reduce the size of uncomplicated infarctions if it is given intravenously within 4 hours of the onset.
