An assessment of the cost effectiveness of a postal toothpaste programme to prevent caries among five-year-old children in the North West of England.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of a postal toothpaste programme to prevent caries in 5-year-old children in the north west of England. PARTICIPANTS: Birth cohorts of children aged 12 months were recruited from high caries risk populations in nine health districts. DESIGN: The results of a randomised controlled trial to measure the effects of a postal toothpaste programme are used and related to the costs of running a similar programme. Children in the trial received free toothpaste on four occasions a year and a toothbrush once a year for four years from age 12 months to 5 years. When aged 5-6 years children were examined by trained, calibrated examiners using BASCD standards. Those who received toothpaste containing 1450 ppm F were found to have a significantly lower mean dmft than those who had not. The costs that would be incurred by a public dental service running such a postal toothpaste programme are identified, measured and related to the likely health improvement that could be achieved. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The cost per tooth saved and the cost per child saved from caries experience and extraction experience. RESULTS: The estimated cost per tooth saved from carious attack was pounds sterling 80.83 and the cost per child of preventing caries experience was pounds sterling 424.38 and avoiding any extractions was pounds sterling 679.01. Analysis resulted in an overestimation of costs and underestimation of benefits. CONCLUSION: The programme achieved a significant caries reduction in children who received the 1450 ppm F toothpaste and the costs are now available to those considering provision of treatment services in areas where children are at high caries risk.
