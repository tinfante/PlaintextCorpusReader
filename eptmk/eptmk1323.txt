Dietary management of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia treated with simvastatin.
The effect of diet on plasma lipids and lipoproteins was examined in 19 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia treated with the HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin. The study was a randomized double-blind cross-over trial of two diets: a low fat diet and a higher fat diet, and was performed to determine whether ongoing attention to diet is necessary for patients receiving this drug for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolaemia. Plasma cholesterol concentration was 6.5 per cent lower on the low fat diet than on the high fat diet. The difference was within the range predicted by the Jacobs modification of the Keys formula from the reported intake on the two diets. The fall on the low fat diet was principally accounted for by a reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol, although high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 also fell. Patients taking HMGCoA reductase inhibitors for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolaemia respond to changes in dietary fat intake. They are thus likely to achieve further reduction in their coronary heart disease risk, and should remain on a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet even when taking these powerful lipid lowering drugs.
