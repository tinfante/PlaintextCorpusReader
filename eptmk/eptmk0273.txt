Environment and well-being before and following smoking ban in office buildings.
The purpose of this study was to compare the well-being, salivary cotinine levels and environmental characteristics of office building workers and their workplace before and after the introduction of a smoking ban. The results showed that one year following the ban, there was an ambiguous change in symptom reporting, a trend towards reduced salivary cotinine levels, and an improvement in measured but not in perceived environmental quality.
