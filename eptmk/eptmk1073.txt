Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the risk of operative site bleeding after tonsillectomy: a quantitative systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This well-conduced review assessed the incidence of peri-operative bleeding complications attributable to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients undergoing tonsillectomy. Although it was unclear whether NSAIDs increased the incidence of bleeding following tonsillectomy, it was suggested that they should be cautiously used until further studies are conducted. The authors' conclusion and recommendations for further research are appropriate.
