Use of intrathecal midazolam to improve perioperative analgesia: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that limited data suggested that adding midazolam to other intrathecal agents could safely reduce perioperative nausea, vomiting and pain during caesarean delivery, but further safety data is required. While the review was generally well-conducted and the conclusion reflected the evidence, it was unclear why caesarean delivery was highlighted when no analysis was conducted for this specific group.
