Conservative management, gamma-knife radiosurgery, and microsurgery for acoustic neurinomas: a systematic review of outcome and risk of three therapeutic options
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the efficacy and risks of three therapeutic options for acoustic neurinomas. It demonstrated that with conservative management and radiologic follow-up the majority of acoustic neurinomas are slow growing but eventually require intervention. Gamma-knife radiosurgery and microsurgery provide tumour control. The analysis was simplistic, and the authors' conclusions about the superior efficacy of microsurgery needs to be interpreted with caution.
