Stress and coping in smoking cessation: A longitudinal examination
Employees from 61 worksites were matched in terms of size and type, and then randomly assigned to one of three conditions that received: (a) self-help manuals, (b) self-help manuals and incentives, or (c) self-help manuals, incentives, and social support groups. The intervention incorporating manuals, incentives, and groups significantly enhanced perceived control over stressors across all time points, and perceived control facilitated successful quitting. Participants who were able to quit smoking perceived less stress in their lives and were able to decrease their initial stress levels. Successful quitters also used less emotion-focused coping than participants who were not able to quit, and their increase in problem-focused coping facilitated quitting.
