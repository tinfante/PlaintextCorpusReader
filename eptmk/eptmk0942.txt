[Effect of trapidil in prevention of pre-eclampsia and fetal retardation]
Pre-eclampsia is suggested to be characterized by a functional imbalance between vascular prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 production. On the basis of this hypothesis it is attempted to correct this pathologic conditions by pharmacological manipulation with Trapidil, a triazolo pyrimidin derivative, because of its effects on the prostanoid metabolism. A prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out to investigate Trapidil in the prevention of pregnancy-induced hypertension or pre-eclampsia. A total of 160 pregnant women with the risk to develop pre-eclampsia received Trapidil or placebo between week 24 and 38 of gestation. The number of patients in whom pregnancy-induced hypertension or pre-eclampsia developed was significantly lower in the Trapidil-treated (5.5%) compared with the placebo-treated group (14.1%). Additionally, a reduced risk of preterm deliveries and severe fetal growth retardation could be observed. In 7 patients with manifest pre-eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension the circulating eicosanoid concentrations were determined before and during Trapidil medication. Trapidil was associated with an about twofold increase of 6-keto PGF1 alpha concentration in the peripheral venous blood, while the concentration of thromboxane A2 revealed no changes.
