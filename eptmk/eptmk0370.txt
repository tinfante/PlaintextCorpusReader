Transdermal selegiline in HIV-associated cognitive impairment: pilot, placebo-controlled study.
The authors conducted a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the transdermal administration of selegiline in HIV+ patients to obtain preliminary data to assess its safety, tolerability, and impact on HIV-associated cognitive impairment. Both selegiline and placebo were well tolerated with few adverse events. Improvements favoring the selegiline group were suggested on single tests of verbal memory and motor/psychomotor performance, warranting a larger study.
