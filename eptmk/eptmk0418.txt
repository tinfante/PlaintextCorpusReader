Magnetic resonance colonography versus colonoscopy as a diagnostic investigation for colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The review assessed the accuracy of magnetic resonance colonography (MRC), compared with conventional colonoscopy, for the detection of colorectal cancer. The authors concluded that MRC is highly discriminative for colorectal cancer, but more research is needed to define its exact diagnostic role. Limitations in the methods of analysis mean that these conclusions should be viewed with caution.
