Clinical course of lamivudine monotherapy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to HBeAg negative chronic HBV infection.
OBJECTIVES: We have evaluated the efficacy of long-term lamivudine monotherapy in patients with decompensated HBeAg-negative/HBV-DNA positive cirrhosis. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical course and outcome of lamivudine treatment in 30 consecutive cirrhotics and compared with 30 HBV untreated historical HBeAg-negative controls matched for age and gender. RESULTS: Significant clinical improvement, defined as a reduction of at least two points in Child-Pugh score was observed in 23 of the 30 treated patients (76.6%) versus none of the 30 patients in the control group (p < 0.0001) after a mean follow-up of 20.6 +/- 12.1(+/-SD) months. There were 10 deaths in the treated group versus 24 in the control group (p= 0.07). Liver-related deaths occurred in five of the eight patients soon after the development of biochemical breakthrough. Patients with clinical improvement had better survival than patients with no improvement (p= 0.04) or those who developed biochemical breakthrough due to YMDD mutants (p= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lamivudine significantly improves liver function in HBeAg-negative decompensated cirrhosis. However, the development of the biochemical breakthrough due to YMDD mutants is associated with fatal outcome.
