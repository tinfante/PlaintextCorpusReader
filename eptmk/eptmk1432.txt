Topical and oral CAM in acne: a review of the empirical evidence and a consideration of its context
CRD SUMMARY: This review examined topical and oral complementary and alternative treatments for acne. The authors concluded that the evidence base was limited; this reflects the poor quality of most of the included studies. The review methodology was poorly reported and the reliability of the review's conclusions is therefore unclear.
