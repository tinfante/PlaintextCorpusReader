Mandibular changes produced by functional appliances in Class II malocclusion: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the efficiency of functional appliances in enhancing mandibular growth in Class II patients. The authors concluded that most studies showed a clinically significant supplementary elongation in total mandibular length following treatment, and the Herbst appliance showed the greatest efficiency. Limitations of the review and the included studies suggest that this conclusion should be viewed with caution.
