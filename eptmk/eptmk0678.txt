Obstetric outcomes after treatment of periodontal disease during pregnancy: systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed whether periodontal disease treatment with scaling and root planing during pregnancy was effective in reducing preterm birth rate. The authors concluded that treatment had no significant effect on incidence of preterm birth, low birthweight infants, spontaneous abortions/stillbirths and overall adverse pregnancy outcomes. This was a well-conducted review and the authors' conclusion is likely to be reliable.
