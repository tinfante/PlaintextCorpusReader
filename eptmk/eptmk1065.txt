Can paraprofessional home visitation enhance early intervention service delivery?
A 1-year randomized trial compared intensive case management (ICM) versus basic case management (BCM) in facilitating early intervention (EI) service use among children in an urban health system. Of 159 participating families with delayed or at-risk preschool-aged children, 88 received ICM from paraprofessionals versus 71 families who received less comprehensive BCM from a nurse. In the ICM versus BCM group, a shorter interval to assessment (98 vs 140 d, p =.05) but similar assessment rate (86% vs 80%, p =.29) was observed. The ICM group had more services recommended per child (1.64 vs 1.16, p < .004) and initiated (1.20 vs 0.85, p < .04). There was no difference in median time to EI program initiation for ICM versus BCM (228 vs 200 d, p = .88) or initiation and visit compliance rate for EI services. Specific efforts to improve outcomes (e.g., decrease initiation time and increase use of EI services) are still needed.
