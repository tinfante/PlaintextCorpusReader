Effectiveness of a home-based exercise intervention for HIV-infected adults: a randomized trial.
The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of a 15-week (20 minutes three times per week) home-based aerobic exercise intervention versus usual care on the physical endurance, immune status, and self-reported health status of 99 HIV-infected adults. In the exercise group, there was no improvement in physical endurance or health-related quality of life (HRQOL), except in the Medical Outcomes Study-HIV Health Survey Overall Health subscale (difference = 12.1, 95% confidence interval = 2.0-22.2, p = .02). Although physical endurance levels were maintained at baseline levels in the intervention group and declined in the control group, differences between the groups were small and not significant. There were also no significant changes in CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. Exercise appears to be safe in HIV-infected patients. Improvements in physical endurance and HRQOL might result if the exercise protocol is longer or progressive. Further research is needed to establish guidelines for exercise in patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy.
