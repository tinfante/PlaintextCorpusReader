Long-term safety and efficacy data on childhood venous thrombosis treated with a low molecular weight heparin: an open-label pilot study of once-daily versus twice-daily enoxaparin administration.
In this open label pilot safety study 80 children over 3 months old with deep venous thrombosis were treated with enoxaparin with a target 4 h anti-factor Xa activity between 0.5-0.8 IU/mL. The children were stratified to receive once daily or twice daily doses. The study end-points were post-thrombotic syndrome, re-thrombosis, bleeding, and therapy-related death. The median duration of treatment was 5 months and the median follow-up was 24 months. No significant differences were found between the two groups of patients. No bleeding or therapy-related deaths occurred. These safety and efficacy data may serve as a basis to initiate an international multicenter study on enoxaparin treatment.
