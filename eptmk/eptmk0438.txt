Octreotide therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review of the evidence from randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: The evidence did not demonstrate a clear benefit for treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with octreotide. Further well-conducted research is needed. Given the limited evidence available, the authors' recommendation to interpret the findings with caution should be borne in mind, and their recommendation for further research seems appropriate.
