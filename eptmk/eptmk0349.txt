Sunscreen use and the risk for melanoma: a quantitative review
CRD SUMMARY: This meta-analysis of 18 case-control studies found no link between sunscreen use and an increased risk of melanoma. The authors used an appropriate methodology, but did not explore how assumptions about missing data might have affected the results. The findings should be interpreted with caution because the included studies were of low quality, used older sunscreen reparations, and had inadequate measures of sunscreen use.
