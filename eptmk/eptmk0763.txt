A critical review of the health-related quality of life of children and adolescents after liver transplantation
CRD SUMMARY: This review investigated health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes in children following liver transplantation. The authors tentatively concluded that there were negative influences on some aspects of HRQL in comparison with a healthy population. The tentative conclusions are appropriate given the limited evidence, and the authors' recommendations for future research appear to be well justified.
