Effect of genetic variants of chemokine receptors on the development of myocardial infarction in Turkish population.
Inflammation is a crucial component of coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction (MI). Chemokine receptors are important modulators of inflammation. Polymorphisms in genes coding for chemokine receptors, CCR2 and CCR5, have been studied as genetic markers of coronary artery disease. In the present study, we investigated whether genetic variants of CCR2-V64I and CCR5-delta32 chemokine receptors have any effect on the development of myocardial infarction. A total of 146 MI patients and 202 control subjects were genotyped for CCR2 and CCR5. CCR2-V64I genotypes were not significantly different between patients with MI and controls (P > 0.05). CCR5-delta32 genotype distribution in cases was significantly different from that of controls (P = 0.042). The CCR5-delta32 wt/deletion genotype frequencies for controls and cases were 0.10 and 0.19, respectively and individuals with CCR5-delta32 wt/deletion genotype had a 2.13-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction (P = 0.0013). Individuals carrying the CCR5-delta32 heterozygote or homozygous variant genotype (deletion/deletion + wt/deletion) had a 1.96-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction compared with the wild-type genotype (wt/wt) (p: 0.016). In conclusion, our data have suggested that genetic variant of CCR5 might be associated with the development of MI. Further larger sample size studies are required to confirm our findings.
