Effectiveness of workplace rehabilitation interventions in the treatment of work-related upper extremity disorders: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed workplace rehabilitation interventions for work-related upper extremity disorders (WRUEDs). The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to adequately assess workplace interventions for WRUEDs and that further research is required. The included studies were small and of poor quality. The authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable.
