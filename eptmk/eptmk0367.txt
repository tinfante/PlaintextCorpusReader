[Somatostatin prophylaxis following cephalic duodenopancreatectomy].
This study was aimed at assessing the value of prophylactic somatostatin after cephalic duodenopancreatectomy. A randomized prospective study was undertaken using two groups of patients, one with prophylactic somatostatin (4.5 mg daily in continuous perfusion for 7 days postoperatively), known as group I, and group II, which did not receive somatostatin. During a five-year period, from April 1989 to April 1994, we performed 35 duodenopancreatectomies, of which 21 belonged to group I and 14 to group II. We found a lower incidence of pancreatic anastomosis fistulae in group I (9.5% vs 35.7%; p < 0.05). We did not find any correlation between prophylaxis with somatostatin and the appearance of other complications or postoperative mortality. The mean time of fistula closure in group I was 5 days while that of group II was 19.2 days. In conclusion, the administration of prophylactic somatostatin after cephalic duodenopancreatectomy reduces the incidence and duration of pancreatic fistula.
