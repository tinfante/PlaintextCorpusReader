Regimen for improved effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression in deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
The incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was assessed in a series of 78 patients undergoing major surgical operations to compare the prophylactic effectiveness of intermittent sequential pneumatic compression alone with the simultaneous use of graduated compression stockings and intermittent sequential pneumatic compression. The diagnosis of DVT was determined with the I-125 fibrinogen-uptake test, Doppler ultrasound, maximum venous outflow by strain-gauge plethysmography, and contrast venography. The incidence of DVT in nonstockinged legs was 9% while that in the stockinged legs was 1%. The simultaneous use of graduated elastic compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression is more effective than pneumatic compression alone in the prevention of postoperative DVT.
