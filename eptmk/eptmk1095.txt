Contrast-enhanced cardiac computed tomographic angiography for coronary artery evaluation
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether computed tomographic angiography improved health outcomes, or whether it was as beneficial as established alternatives such as conventional coronary angiography. The cautious conclusions appear appropriate given the paucity of evidence, but the restricted search and poor reporting of review methods make it difficult to assess the reliability of the results.
