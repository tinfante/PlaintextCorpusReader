Total or subtotal hysterectomy for benign uterine diseases: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The author concluded that total hysterectomy reduces prolapse and urinary incontinence, while operation time, bleeding and post-operative complications occur less often with subtotal hysterectomy. These conclusions should be interpreted with caution given the possibility of language and publication bias and failure to appropriately evaluate study quality.
