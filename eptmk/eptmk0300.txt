Narrative review: furosemide for hypercalcemia. An unproven yet common practice
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that evidence does not support the use of furosemide in common practice as the primary treatment of hypercalcaemia of any cause.  Given several limitations with the included studies and review, including small sample size, indirect treatment comparisons and potential bias, and the paucity of current evidence, the authors' conclusions should be interpreted with extreme caution.
