Fluvoxamine maleate, a serotonergic antidepressant; a comparison with chlorimipramine.
1. Fluvoxamine is a potent serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, with little or no noradrenergic or anticholinergic activity. 2. The results of three studies using an almost identical protocol with a prospectively randomized, double-blind design comparing fluvoxamine and chlorimipramine are presented. 3. In a population of 98 subjects suffering from a variety of depressive conditions, there was a marked improvement over four weeks in both groups. dosage was maintained between 150 and 300 mg per day. 4. There were no changes of clinical importance in vital signs, hematology or biochemistry, but pulse rates increased in the chlorimipramine group. 5. There were fewer concurrent signs and symptoms in the fluvoxamine group, especially those attributable to anticholinergic activity.
