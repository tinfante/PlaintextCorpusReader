Prevention of postoperative venous thromboembolism by external pneumatic calf compression in patients with gynecologic malignancy.
One hundred seven patients undergoing major surgery for gynecologic malignancy participated in a controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of pneumatic calf compression in the prevention of postoperative deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. External pneumatic calf compression was applied intraoperatively and for five postoperative days. All patients were prospectively screened for deep venous thrombosis with impedance plethysmography and 125I-fibrinogen leg counting. Deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary emboli were detected in 18 of 52 control group patients (34.6%) whereas in seven of 55 (12.7%) of those treated with external pneumatic calf compression (P less than .005). External pneumatic calf compression was most effective during the first five days postoperatively and also reduced the incidence of deep venous thrombosis in patients at highest risk. When applied during surgery and for five days postoperatively, external pneumatic calf compression significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative venous thrombosis.
