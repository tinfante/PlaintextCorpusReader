D-dimer for the exclusion of acute venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer assays, and the variability of such measures among studies of the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The authors appropriately concluded that, for excluding PE or DVT, a negative result on quantitative rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is as diagnostically useful as a normal lung scan or negative duplex ultrasonography finding.
