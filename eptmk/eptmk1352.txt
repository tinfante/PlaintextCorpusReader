Brief psychotherapy in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Outcome at one year.
Thirty out-patients with severe anorexia nervosa were randomly allocated to either 12 sessions of dietary advice or 12 sessions of combined individual and family psychotherapy. At one-year follow-up both groups showed significant overall improvement, and the dietary advice group showed significant weight gain. A similar mean weight gain for the psychotherapy patients did not reach statistical significance, but this group made significant improvements in sexual and social adjustment.
