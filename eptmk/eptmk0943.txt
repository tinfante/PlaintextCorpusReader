A trial of carbamazepine in borderline personality disorder.
Borderline personality disorder does not have a first choice pharmacological treatment. We studied 20 borderline inpatients in a double-blind parallel placebo-controlled trial with carbamazepine for a mean of 30.9 days. No significant positive effects of the drug were found.
