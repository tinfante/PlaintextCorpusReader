Intravaginal misoprostol 600 microg and 800 microg for the treatment of early pregnancy failure.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the respective effectiveness and safety of 600 microg and 800 microg of intravaginal misoprostol for complete abortion in cases of early pregnancy failure (occurring in the first 12 weeks).
METHOD: A total of 114 women with a diagnosis of early pregnancy failure made by transvaginal ultrasonography at Rajavithi Hospital between November 25, 2002 and July 31, 2003, were assigned randomly to 2 groups of equal size. In one group the women received 600 microg of misoprostol and in the other 800 microg of misoprostol intravaginally.
RESULTS: The rate of complete abortion within 24 h was significantly higher in the group that received 800 microg of misoprostol (68.4%) than in the other group (45.6%) (P<0.05). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding time interval between misoprostol insertion and complete abortion or side effects.
CONCLUSION: Intravaginal misoprostol 800 microg is significantly more effective than vaginal misoprostol 600 microg for the termination of an early pregnancy failure, with no significant differences in side effects.
