Non-invasive brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that transcranial magnetic stimulation shows a significant modest positive effect, and that electroconvulsive therapy may also have a significant effect, on the motor function of patients with Parkinson's disease. These conclusions should be regarded with some caution, mainly because of a lack of information on the included studies.
