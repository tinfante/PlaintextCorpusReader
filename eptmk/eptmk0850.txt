[Prevention of re-occlusion after recanalisation of occluded arteries by the catheter method (author's transl)].
In a double-blind study, prevention of re-thrombosis was tested on 101 patients in whom stenosis or segmental occlusion of a large artery of the lower limbs had been successfully removed by the intraluminal catheter method. The combination of 75 mg dipyridamol and 330 mg acetylsalicylic acid, three times daily by mouth, proved to be slightly more effective than acetylsalicylic acid alone at the same dosage. In the group with the combined treatment 84% of the arteries remained open, compared with 70% on acetylsalicylic acid alone.
