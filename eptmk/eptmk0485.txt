The efficacy of splinting for lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the efficacy of splinting for lateral epicondylitis. The authors concluded that there was some, but not conclusive, support for the use of splinting for lateral epicondylitis and that further research was required. There was limited evidence from the included small, generally flawed studies. Given the limitations of the evidence, the authors' tentative conclusions about efficacy appear appropriate.
