Nutritional supplementation for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: Alpha-lipoic acid, chromium, folic acid, isoflavones, magnesium, pycnogenol, selenium, vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc showed positive effects on various outcome measures relating to insulin resistance and cardiovascular factors in patients with type 2 diabetes. Given the lack of reporting on methodological processes and unclear results, the authors' conclusions should be interpreted with caution as they may be unreliable.
