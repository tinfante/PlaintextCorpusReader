[Comparative parameters of myelotoxicity in patients treated with simultaneous chemotherapy and radiotherapy or only radiotherapy]
BACKGROUND: The Modern oncological treatment usually consists of the different kind of the therapies. Improvement of survival and local control of disease could be possible with combined treatments: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, etc. However if these treatments are given concomitantly one can expect higher toxicity. AIM: Comparation of parameters of miclotoxicity: red blood cell count, white blood cell count, platelets and hemoglobin in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma treated with concomitant chemo-radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1997-1999, we performed prospective, by randomised, study, and 80 patients were divided in two groups: Group A--40 patients treated with concomitant chemo-radiotherapy versus, Group B--40 patients treated with radiotherapy alone. Red blood cell count, white blood cell count, platelets and hemoglobin were evaluated before enrollement, during the theraphy, after 3 and 6 months, according to CTC toxicity criteria. RESULTS: We perform statistical analysis using H2 test, and we found no significant difference in mild nad severe toxicity in red blood cell count, white blood cell count, platelets and hemoglobin among groups.
