DILEMMA: logic engineering in primary care, shared care and oncology (AIM Project A2005).
The aim of DILEMMA is to provide tools for the development of decision support systems for use in general medical practice, hospital-based cancer care, and shared care of cancer and cardiology patients. In primary care, the project intends to provide aids to clinical performance in prescribing, referral and the use of clinical guidelines. The demonstrator applications involve telematics and knowledge-based methodology, using an approach termed logic engineering which combines logic programming and software lifecycle methods. DILEMMA will demonstrate systems to assist shared care and home care which should help reduce pressure on secondary health resources and, by disseminating best practice knowledge, improve patient care and patient quality of life.
