Patient satisfaction with implant-supported mandibular overdentures. A comparison of three treatment strategies with ITI-dental implants.
In a randomized, controlled clinical trial, 110 edentulous patients with atrophic mandibles were treated with International Team for Oral Implantology-dental implants using three different treatment strategies: a mandibular overdenture supported by two implants with ball attachments, two implants with an interconnecting bar, or four interconnected implants. The patients' opinions and their social functioning were evaluated by means of a questionnaire directly before and 16 months after treatment. Before treatment most patients had complaints about the retention of their mandibular denture. Sixteen months after treatment almost all patients were generally satisfied with their dentures. Since no significant difference was found between the three treatment strategies, it was concluded that simple implant treatment such as an overdenture retained by two ball attachments is sufficient.
