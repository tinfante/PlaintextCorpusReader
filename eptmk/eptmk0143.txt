Tiotropium for the treatment of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review with meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that the use of tiotropium was beneficial in treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Previous evidence in favour of the superiority of tiotropium over long-acting beta-agonists was also supported. As the results may not be generalisable and potential bias was possible, these conclusions may not be reliable.
