Brace treatment of Colles' fracture.
Twenty patients with Colles' fractures were treated with a functional brace that allows wrist motion. The result was compared with a similar group of patients treated with a plaster cast. Dorsal displacement of the fracture was less and wrist function was better in the brace group. Swelling of the hand during the early stages was observed in the brace group; and because this may necessitate brace adjustment, increased medical supervision is necessary for this period.
