Sildimac: a new delivery system for silver sulfadiazine in the treatment of full-thickness burn injuries.
Wound care is painful for the patient with a burn injury and tedious for the burn unit staff but necessary to remove exudates and debris and to limit infections. In an effort to circumvent daily dressing changes while ensuring optimal wound protection, Sildimac (Marion Laboratories, Kansas City, Mo.), a new drug delivery system for silver sulfadiazine, was developed. When silver sulfadiazine, a topical antimicrobial commonly used for the treatment of burns, is incorporated into the delivery system, the drug is released in a sustained fashion. We report here the results of a multicenter evaluation of the safety and efficiency of Sildimac for treatment of full-thickness burn wounds. Sildimac, when left in place for up to 4 days, appears to be as effective as twice-daily wound cleansing and application of Silvadene cream 1% (Marion Laboratories, Kansas City, Mo.) for the treatment of full-thickness burns.
