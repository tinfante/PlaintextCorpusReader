Noncemented femoral components in total hip arthroplasty for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Twenty-seven patients with rheumatoid arthritis underwent cementless total hip arthroplasty from 1982 through 1989. We performed all operations through a posterior approach. Postoperatively, patient convalescence consisted of ambulation with crutches, followed by weight bearing as tolerated until pain and discomfort subsided. We contacted 25 (92.5%) patients for follow-up. Combined, these patients received 34 total hip arthroplasties. The patients ranged in age from 14 to 69 years old with a mean age of 42.9 years. The follow-up period ranged from two to eight years with a mean of five and one-half years. The mean preoperative total Harris hip score was 48 (range 31-68). The mean total Harris hip score at latest follow-up was 80 (range 44-95). Hip pain status and functional ability were important indicators of treatment efficacy. The lower incidence of pain, as well as the increase in functional abilities experienced by the patients, suggests that cementless total hip arthroplasty is a preferable alternative to fixed arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
