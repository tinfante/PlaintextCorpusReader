Problem driver remediation: a meta-analysis of the driver improvement literature
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effect of state driver improvement programmes on subsequent traffic violations and accidents. The authors concluded that driver improvement interventions, particularly licence suspension or revocation, reduce the risk of accidents and violations. The robustness of the conclusions are weakened by methodological and reporting limitations to the review and unexplained variability in the meta-analysis.
