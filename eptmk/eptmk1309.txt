Steroid avoidance in liver transplantation: meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared steroid-free and steroid-based immunosuppression after liver transplants. The analysis suggested no short-term detrimental effects with steroid avoidance, but study heterogeneity, short-term follow-up and small trial sizes meant that no firm recommendations could be made. The authors' cautious conclusions appear appropriate, despite some omissions in reporting of methodologies used to extract data and assess study quality.
