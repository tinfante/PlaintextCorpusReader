The staging concept--an approach to the assessment of outcome of ambulatory care.
The paper describes a method to evaluate patient care. The technique is based on the staging concept. Its basic premise is that the seriousness of a patient's condition at some point in the treatment process is a good indicator of the outcome of the previous parts of the process. Data were collected for 5,000 patients who had been admitted to a sample of hospitals in two California cities with a primary diagnosis matching one of the diseases for which staging criteria had been developed. The results indicate that the staging technique can be used to distinguish between the outcomes of ambulatory care received by different population groups.
