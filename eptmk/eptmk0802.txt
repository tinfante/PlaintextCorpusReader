A multicentre evaluation of the two-layered repair of postpartum perineal trauma.
We set out to compare a policy of two-layered postpartum perineal repair leaving the skin unsutured with a policy of three-layered repair, which involved skin closure. Parturients who sustained a second-degree tear or an episiotomy in four Nigerian centers were randomised to have either a two-layered repair (417 women) or a three-layered repair (406 women). Fewer women in the two-layered group reported perineal pain at 48 hours (57% vs. 65%, relative risk [RR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78-0.97) and 14 days postpartum (22% vs. 28%, RR 0.77, CI 0.61-0.98). The two-layered repair was also associated with reduced risk of suture removal (6% vs. 10%, RR 0.62, CI 0.39-0.99), and less superficial dyspareunia at 3 months (6% vs. 12%, RR 0.52, CI 0.33-0.81). The rates of wound healing were similar between the two groups. Leaving the skin unsutured during postpartum perineal repair reduces perineal pain and dyspareunia.
