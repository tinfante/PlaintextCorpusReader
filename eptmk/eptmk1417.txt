Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids and the risk of pneumonia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This well-conducted review assessed the risks of pneumonia associated with long-term inhaled corticosteroid use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The authors concluded that there is a significantly increased risk of pneumonia associated with these treatments, without a concomitant increase in mortality. This conclusion was based on the evidence of the review and is likely to be reliable.
