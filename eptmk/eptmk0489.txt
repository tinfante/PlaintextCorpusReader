The medical management of ectopic pregnancy: a meta-analysis comparing 'single dose' and 'multidose' regimens
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed single- and multidose intramuscular methotrexate regimens for the medical treatment of ectopic pregnancy. The authors concluded that methotrexate regimens have high success rates and that multidose regimens are more effective than single-dose regimens. The evidence supporting the author's conclusions is not strong.
