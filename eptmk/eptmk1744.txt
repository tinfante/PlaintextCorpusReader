Psychosocial changes following retirement.
This study was designed to: (a) identify the perceptions of retirees about changes in their life patterns during retirement; (b) investigate the kinds of adjustment problems occurring in retirement as a basis for developing prevention oriented pre-retirement programs; and (c) identify extant factors which could demonstrate underlying themes relating to retirement adjustment. A 72-item, multiple response questionnaire was used to gather demographic data, information on use of time, pre-retirement planning, health problems, changing life patterns, and adjustment to retirement. It is the latter which is reported in these findings. The population included 1565 retirees from a designated company living in the south-eastern United States of America, with a response of 764 subjects (48.82%). Findings suggest the respondents were generally healthy and well adjusted; however, numerous adjustment problem areas were identified within the six life patterns. Additional factor analysis (principal components) demonstrated four factors of particular importance: satisfaction with retirement, retirement concerns, spousal relationships, and pre-retirement preparation outcomes.
