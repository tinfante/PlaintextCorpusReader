Comparing smoking treatment programs for lighter smokers with and without a history of heavier smoking.
The study examined the impact of counseling intensity (high vs. low) combined with either bupropion or the nicotine patch. Two hundred sixty participants smoking 6 to 15 cigarettes per day (cpd) were enrolled in a year-long study to examine the effects of treatment. Four groups of smokers under medication-blinded conditions were compared for treatment completion and abstinence at three follow-up points from the initiation of treatment (Weeks 12, 26, and 52). Both counseling groups had similar treatment completion rates (i.e., defined by a combination of counseling attendance and medication adherence levels). There was a main treatment effect for abstinence favoring the high counseling condition in early follow-up (Week 12) and for continuous abstinence. Participants with a history of heavier smoking (> or =20 cpd) and African American smokers were least likely to be smoke free at the end of the study. The study has implications for identifying the treatment needs of lighter smokers.
