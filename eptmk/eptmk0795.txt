Comparison of hemodialysis, hemofiltration, and acetate-free biofiltration for ESRD: systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared haemodialysis, haemofiltration, haemodiafiltration and acetate-free biofiltration for patients with end-stage renal disease. The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine the most effective method of extracorporeal renal replacement. This was generally a well-conducted review and the authors' conclusions are likely to be robust.
