A controlled trial of weekly ultrasound therapy in chronic leg ulceration.
In a controlled trial to ascertain whether ultrasound given weekly in conjunction with a standard treatment for chronic leg ulcers improves the rate of healing 56 patients were randomised to standard treatment (paste impregnated bandage and a self-adhesive elastic bandage) and 52 to standard treatment plus pulsed ultrasound given weekly. After 12 weeks the proportion of ulcers healed was 20% greater in the ultrasound than in the control group.
