One year later: using role theory to evaluate a new delivery system.
This is the second part of a two-part article that presents findings from a staff nurse survey one year after the implementation of primary nursing on four medical and surgical pilot units in a tertiary teaching hospital. The introduction of primary nursing was one phase of a project to develop theory-based nursing practice within the institution. The researchers hoped that obtaining the staff nurse perspective on the change to primary nursing would provide evaluative information and suggestions to provide additional support in the project. Role theory (Hardy, 1978) provides the theoretical framework for this study. While the previous article discussed issues related to the change process, this article focuses on evaluation of role transitions.
