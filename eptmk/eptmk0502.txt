Reliability of reporting left ventricular systolic function by echocardiography: a systematic review of 3 methods
CRD SUMMARY: The review compared the diagnostic accuracy of echographic methods (Simpson's rule, wall motion index, visual assessment) with contrast or radionuclide ventriculography for the assessment of left ventricular systolic function. The conclusion that echocardiography provides moderately accurate assessments appears reliable.
