AIDS prevention in homosexual and bisexual men: results of a randomized trial evaluating two risk reduction interventions.
This study evaluates two AIDS risk-reduction interventions targeted at homosexual and bisexual men. Participants were randomized into two peer-led interventions: both involved a lecture on 'safer sex', and one provided a skills-training component during which men could discuss and rehearse the negotiation of safer sexual encounters. Follow-up data collection assessed self-reported changes in sexual behavior at 6 and 12 months. Skills training increased condom use for insertive anal intercourse. In sessions providing skills training, condom use increased, on average, by 44% between pre-test and second follow-up compared with only 11% on average in sessions which did not provide such training.
