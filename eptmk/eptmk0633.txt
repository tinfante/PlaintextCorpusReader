Computer-supported versus manually-generated nursing care plans: a comparison of patient problems, nursing interventions, and AIDS patient outcomes.
The number and type of activated patient problems and the number of nursing interventions in computer-supported and manually-generated nursing care plans for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients hospitalized for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were compared. There were significantly more activated patient problems (p = 0.005) and nursing interventions (p = 0.002) listed using the computer-supported care planning system. The top ranked problems in both systems were reflective of the clinical presentation of acute PCP. The problem, potential for increased risk of infection, was activated more frequently using the computer-supported care plan. There were no significant differences in patient outcome as measured by functional status and patients' self-ratings of physical condition at hospital discharge.
