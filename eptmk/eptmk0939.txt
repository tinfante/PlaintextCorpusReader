Healing of fresh tibial fractures with OP-1. A preliminary report.
Osteogenic proteins (OP) are elements of a class of natural growth factors called Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP). A specific member of this class is OP-1, a human recombinant protein that has osteogenic properties. The osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties of OP-1, with its specific collagen matrix, promote the generation of new functionally active, biologically and biomechanically mature bone. We carried out a clinical study to verify the potential of this protein in fresh tibial closed fractures, using OP-1 associated with osteosynthesis by means of a monolateral external fixator.
