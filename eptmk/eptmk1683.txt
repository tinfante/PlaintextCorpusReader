Statins in stroke prevention and carotid atherosclerosis: systematic review and up-to-date meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effects of statins on stroke. The authors concluded that statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and may reduce the incidence of any type of stroke. Given that the review methods and study quality were not reported, and that the search for individual studies was limited, it is difficult to comment on the strength of the evidence underpinning the authors' conclusions.
