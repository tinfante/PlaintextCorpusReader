Advantages of left over right lateral tilt for caesarean section.
The relative merits of right and left lateral tilt were assessed in 75 parturients at elective caesarean section. Significant maternal hypotension (aortocaval occlusion) occurred more frequently with rightward tilt (left hip supported). The clinical and biochemical status of the fetus was generally more favourable with left lateral tilt, as were the maternal-to-fetal blood gas gradients and relationships. The routine use of left lateral tilt is advocated.
