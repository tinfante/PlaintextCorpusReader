Graduated compression stockings in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
Venous volume (venous capacity) of the calf is low in patients with acute myocardial infarction, who also have a high risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The effect of graduated compression stockings on the venous volume and on the incidence of DVT was therefore studied in 80 patients aged 70 years and above with acute myocardial infarction. Graduated compression stockings were randomly fitted to one leg, the other serving as a control, after which the venous volume was measured by strain gauge plethysmography. The incidence of DVT was measured by the 125I fibrinogen uptake test. Venous volume was significantly higher in legs treated with graduated compression stockings compared to control legs. DVT developed in eight control legs but not in any leg treated with graduated compression stockings (P = 0.003). DVT was also significantly more frequent in women compared to men and the majority of DVT developed in legs with very low venous volume values.
