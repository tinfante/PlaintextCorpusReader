Staple line reinforcement in laparoscopic bariatric surgery: does it actually make a difference? A systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The review found that staplers in bariatric surgery may not be uniformly reliable and staple line reinforcement did not seem to have any clear benefit for reduction of leaks. Wide variation between the studies, discrepancies between figures and text and potential bias in the review process mean the authors' conclusions should be viewed with caution.
