Diagnostic evaluation of shoulder pain: a systematic review on the accuracy of signs and symptoms related to rotator cuff disorders
CRD SUMMARY: The review assessed the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of history taking and clinical tests for impingement or rotator cuff tears of the shoulder. No data on the accuracy of history taking were identified, and the majority of clinical tests were evaluated in single studies. The author appropriately concluded that the available evidence was limited.
