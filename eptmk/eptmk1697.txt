The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and endometriosis staging.
This study aims to determine whether the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system can influence American Society for Reproductive Medicine endometriosis staging scores, as assessed through second-look laparoscopies, and to compare the results with those obtained with a GnRH agonist. Both treatments reduced the extent of pelvic endometriotic lesions in patients with chronic pelvic pain.
