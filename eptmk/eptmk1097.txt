Efficacy of folic acid supplementation in stroke prevention: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the efficacy of folic acid supplementation in the prevention of stroke. Folic acid administration was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of stroke which had greater statistical significance when folic acid was given for primary stroke prevention. Whilst the conclusions are supported by the evidence presented, it is not possible to determine fully their reliability.
