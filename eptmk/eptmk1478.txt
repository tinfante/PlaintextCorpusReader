Prognostic value of troponin after elective percutaneous coronary intervention: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that measurement of troponin levels provides important prognostic information on risk of death during follow-up in patients who have undergone an elective percutaneous coronary intervention. The authors' conclusions are in line with the evidence presented, but should be treated with caution given that the review had various methodological and reporting limitations.
