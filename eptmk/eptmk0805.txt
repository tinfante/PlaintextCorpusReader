[Clebopride in premedication in ambulatory interventions in general anesthesia].
The authors examine the antiemetic effects of 1 mg clebopride administered iv after surgery, vs a placebo, by making a double blind randomized study on two groups of 40 women comparable by age and weight. The 2 groups of outpatients, admitted for short gynecological surgery, underwent diagnostic uterine curettage. They were anaesthetized with a cocktail of 2.5 mcg/kg fentanyl and 0.25 mg/kg ketamine, on spontaneous respiration. Nausea, vomiting and the other side effects were evaluated 3-6 hours after surgery. Statistically, clebopride proved more effective than placebo against nausea and vomiting (P ranging between 0.05-0.01), with no relevant side effects.
