[Efficacy and tolerability of ketoprofen lysine salt foam for topical use in the treatment of traumatic pathologies of the locomotor apparatus]
In this study the authors evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a foam of 15% ketoprofen lysine salt versus placebo in patients with articular traumas, pains and strains, distortions etc. All parameters considered were statistically significantly decreased after 7 days of active treatment as compared to placebo. Pain score decreased significantly at pressure (p < 0.001), pain on active movement (p < 0.005), pain on passive movement and pain at rest. Efficacy of the active foam was graded as satisfactory in 81.7% and its tolerability in 92.7% versus 44% and 29% with placebo respectively. Patients reported high acceptability (89%) of the new foam formulation. No systemic or local side effects were observed or reported. The 15% ketoprofen lysine salt foam for topical use can be considered an effective antiinflammatory and analgesic drug for the treatment of minor orthopedic and traumatic disorders, and was found to be perfectly tolerated.
