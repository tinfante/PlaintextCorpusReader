Noncontingent reinforcement is an empirically supported treatment for problem behavior exhibited by individuals with developmental disabilities
CRD SUMMARY: The review concluded that fixed time reinforcer delivery (plus extinction and schedule thinning) was the most efficacious treatment identified for behavioural problems in individuals with developmental disabilities. Reporting of the review process was poor. The conclusion is likely to be reliable, but the lack of data for alternative treatments prevented their accurate assessment.
