Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: meta-analyses of the effects of corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that there is little evidence to support a link between the use of corticosteroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, the reliability of the review's findings is unclear given the poor reporting of review methods and the potential methodological weaknesses of the study data.
