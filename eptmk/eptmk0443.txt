Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention: a meta-analysis of randomized and nonrandomized studies
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded there was a decreased rate of revascularisation and 12-month major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events for off-pump coronary artery bypass graft compared with percutaneous coronary intervention. The authors' conclusions represent the evidence presented but, given the possibility of publication bias and the unknown quality of included studies, the authors' conclusions should be interpreted with caution.
