The effect of postoperative wound drainage reinfusion in reducing the need for blood transfusions in elective total joint arthroplasty: a prospective, randomized study.
A prospective, randomized study was conducted in 24 patients using the Solcotrans Orthopaedic Drainage Reinfusion System (Smith & Nephew Richards Inc, Memphis, Tenn) for postoperative blood salvage in total joint arthroplasty. The amount of postoperative autologous blood salvage averaged 946 mL. Only 25% of the study group required postoperative transfusions, compared to 83% of the control group (P = .016). In total knee arthroplasties, only 11% of the study group required transfusions, compared to 78% of the control group (P = .018). There were no transfusion reactions, infectious complications, or coagulopathies. Postoperative blood salvage is a safe, reliable, and effective source of autologous blood.
