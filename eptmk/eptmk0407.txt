Nutrition and physical activity interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in health care settings: a quantitative review with a focus on women.
The authors conducted a quantitative literature review of the impact of 32 diet and physical activity (PA) interventions delivered in health care settings on cardiovascular disease risk factors. Intervention effects were relatively modest but statistically significant for PA, body mass index or weight, dietary fat, blood pressure, and total and low-density lipoprotein serum cholesterol. Intervention effects were generally larger for samples with a mean age >50 years and for studies with <6 months follow-up. Type of comparison group, type of intervention, and use of a behavior theory did not have a consistent impact on intervention effects. Few studies focused on persons of color, although the results from these studies are promising.
