Recombinant LH supplementation to recombinant FSH during induced ovarian stimulation in the GnRH-antagonist protocol: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review found no statistically significant differences in implantation and pregnancy rates when supplementing recombinant follicle stimulating hormone with recombinant luteinising hormone for women undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilisation. Overall, the potential for publication bias, the paucity of data, and the limited reporting of study methods suggest the conclusions should be interpreted with caution.
