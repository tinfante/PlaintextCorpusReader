Parent involvement in treatment for ADHD: a meta-analysis of the published studies
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effect of parent-involved psychosocial interventions in the treatment of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The authors concluded that family interventions have a low to moderate effect on ADHD and externalising symptoms, but a moderate effect on child-internalising symptoms. Limitations of the analysis and uncertain quality of the included studies restrict interpretation of the results.
