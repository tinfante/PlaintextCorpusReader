The effectiveness of non-surgical interventions in the treatment of Charcot foot
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that bisphosphonates may improve the healing of Charcot foot when added to standard interventions to control the position and shape of the foot. The review was generally well conducted but, given the small number of included studies, small sample sizes and variation between the studies, the authors' conclusions should be treated with caution.
