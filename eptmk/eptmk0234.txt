Rehabilitation for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed rehabilitation programmes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The authors concluded that, compared with no rehabilitation, rehabilitation improved exercise capacity and reduced shortness of breath. Although it appears to be supported by the evidence presented, differences between the included studies limit the strength of this finding.
