Clinical comparison of the analgesic efficacy of suprofen, diflunisal and placebo in the treatment of pain after meniscectomy.
Suprofen 200 mg and suprofen 400 mg were found to be as efficacious as diflunisal 750 mg in a single-dose, double-blind randomized study of 130 hospitalized patients with pain following meniscectomy. Pain intensity was measured using both an interval scale and a visual analogue scale. Pain indices derived from both scales as well as the physician's global evaluation were consistent in demonstrating that suprofen is an effective analgesic agent in the relief of moderate to severe pain following orthopedic surgery.
