Efficacy and safety of treatments for childhood psoriasis: a systematic literature review
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that calcipotriene with or without corticosteroids was the treatment of choice for childhood psoriasis, followed by dithranol. Methotrexate was the systemic treatment of choice. Evidence on specific treatments was limited: based at most on one randomised controlled trial of unknown quality plus studies of less reliable design. This means that the conclusions should be interpreted with caution.
