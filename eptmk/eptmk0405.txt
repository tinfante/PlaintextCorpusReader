Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis protocol--needs active enforcement.
Each hospital department tends to have its own DVT prophylaxis protocol generally based on the recommendations of the THRIFT consensus group. This is developed to help the junior medical staff to prescribe the appropriate prophylaxis according to risk assessment. However, adherence to the protocol tends to be haphazard unless actively enforced. This study is aimed at determining whether active enforcement of the protocol improves the uptake of prophylaxis.
