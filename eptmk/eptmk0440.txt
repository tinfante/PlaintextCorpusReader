Off-pump coronary artery bypass may increase late mortality: a meta-analysis of randomized trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may increase mortality at one year or more (late all-cause mortality) compared with on-pump CABG. Some caution is warranted in interpreting the reliability of the authors' conclusion, given potential methodological limitations in the review process and results which appeared to be heavily influenced by one trial.
