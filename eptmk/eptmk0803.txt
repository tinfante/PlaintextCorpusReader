A comparative study of the clinical effects of pentobarbital and diazepam given orally as preoperative medication.
The clinical effects of pentobarbital, 100 mg, and diazepam, 10 mg, given orally as preoperative medications before dental surgery were tested in a double-blind study in 50 adult patients. The concnetrations of pentobarbital and diazepam (plus its three active metabolites) in plasma, measured by gas chromatography, were correlated with their clinical effects as assessed both subjectively and objectively (sedation, apprehension, excitement, dizziness, pre- and post-operative emetic effect, increase or decrease in systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and ease of venipuncture). No significant difference in the effects of these two agents was observed, nor was there any obvious relationship between the concentration in plasma and clinical effect.
