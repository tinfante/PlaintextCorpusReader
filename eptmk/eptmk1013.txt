Double-blind study of nimodipine in non-severe stroke.
We evaluated the effect of nimodipine (30 mg q.i.d. orally for 14 days) on acute ischemic stroke of mild or moderate severity in a unicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study. Treatment had to be started after CT, within 48 h of infarct in patients with a Mathew scale sum score between 50 and 75. The duration of follow-up was 4 months. Eight of the 60 randomized patients were excluded because of incorrect diagnosis. For the remaining 52 patients, 24 were allocated to nimodipine and 28 to placebo. Analysis of variance and covariance and repeated measurements of the Mathew scale scores showed no difference between the two groups, who had continuous and parallel improvement. There was no recurrent stroke, but 1 control died 4 weeks after stroke. Treatment with nimodipine was well tolerated (hypotension: 1 treated patient, 3 controls; bradycardia: 1 treated patient, 2 controls; sGPT increase: 1 treated patient, 1 control). The lack of efficacy of nimodipine in this study may be due to: (1) the neurologic deficit not being severe enough, or (2) the delay before treatment was too long.
