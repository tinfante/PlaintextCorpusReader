Lower levels of in-stent late loss are not associated with the risk of stent thrombosis in patients receiving drug-eluting stents
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that the risk of stent thrombosis and in-stent late post-implantation of a drug-eluting stent was not related to in-stent late loss values. Despite the limitations of the review, there were a large number of included studies with similar and consistent results and the conclusions are likely to be reliable. Generalisability of the results was uncertain.
