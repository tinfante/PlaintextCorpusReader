Objective cognitive performance associated with electroconvulsive therapy for depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The review found that cognitive impairments following ECT appeared mostly to be limited to the three days after treatment and that subsequently most functions improved beyond baseline levels. Evidence was lacking about several cognitive domains. Although the review was generally well conducted, some caution is advisable in interpreting the conclusions due to a failure to assess study validity.
