The effect of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) on the risk of fall and fracture: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that there is a trend towards a reduced risk of falls associated with vitamin D treatment. Evidence relating to fracture risk was inconclusive. The conclusion about risk of falls is not well supported by the evidence presented, as no benefit was found for postmenopausal women and the review was not designed to apply to any other population group.
