Views of mothers and midwives participating in the Bristol randomized, controlled trial of active management of the third stage of labor.
Mothers and midwives who had participated in the Bristol randomized controlled trial of active versus physiologic management of the Third Stage of Labor were asked for their views. One hundred ninety-one mothers (11% of the total randomized) and 49 midwives completed self-administered questionnaires. Both mothers and midwives commented adversely about the length of the third stage under physiologic management. In general, their views were in accord with the conclusions of the main trial (based on clinical data, including maternal blood loss, length of third stage, need for therapeutic oxytocic agents, and specified neonatal morbidity) in favor of continuing with the current practice of active management.
