A review of anti-D treatment of childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Treatment of childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is still an area of controversy. We reviewed the literature on anti-D treatment. Most studies used intravenous anti-D. Single doses of 50 microg/kg increased the platelet count to >or=20x10(9)/L in 70% of the children within 3 days. Intravenous anti-D seems safe in classic childhood ITP although hemolysis and occasionally renal failure may be of concern. A few studies reported intramuscularly or subcutaneously administered anti-D. Further studies on the optimal dose and route of administration of anti-D are warranted.
