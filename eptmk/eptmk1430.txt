Statins and cognition: what can we learn from existing randomized trials?
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the use of statins solely for the prevention of dementia, but that the results from current ongoing trials will help provide a more definitive answer. The limited search, lack of a validity assessment and poorly structured synthesis mean it is difficult to assess the reliability of these conclusions.
