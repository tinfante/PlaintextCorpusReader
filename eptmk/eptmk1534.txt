Testosterone and depression: systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that testosterone replacement therapy may have an antidepressant effect, especially for patients who also have hypogonadism or HIV infection. Limitations in the review methods and the evidence base suggest that the conclusions should be treated with caution. The conclusions are unlikely to be applicable to the general population of patients with depression.
