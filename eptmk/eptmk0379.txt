Efficacy of anticoagulation post-inferior vena caval filter placement.
Anticoagulation with heparin or Coumadin is usually effective in the management of deep vein thrombosis; however, if anticoagulation treatment is contraindicated, is ineffective, or leads to adverse effects, inferior vena caval (IVC) placement of a filter is indicated. The purpose of this study is to determine whether increased early adverse effects are present in patients not given anticoagulation medication after placement of an IVC filter. The records of 240 consecutive patients who received IVC filter placement were reviewed for indications for placement, as well as for whether patients received anticoagulation medication on discharge. There were 41 in-patient mortalities. Of the remaining 199 patients, 100 were discharged and prescribed anticoagulation medication, and 99 were not. Patients were followed for 3 to 60 months. These results suggest that no early adverse effects are seen in patients who are not given anticoagulants after IVC filter placement.
