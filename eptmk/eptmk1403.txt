[Blood-saving effectiveness of preoperative reservation of autoblood for surgical treatment of ischemic heart disease]
A randomized prospective investigation included 143 patients (coronary shunting for IHD under conditions of extracorporeal circulation--EC). In 55 patients exfusion of autoblood followed by its transfusion after finishing EC was made before operation in 88 patients. A cell saver was used in all the patients from the moment of cutting the skin for the collection of blood and for the collection of perfusate left in the EC apparatus after finishing EC and for autotransfusion of the drainage fluid released after operation. The preoperative reservation of autoblood in patients with IHD for operations of coronary bypass under conditions of EC and using the cell saver gives higher values of hemoglobin and erythrocytes by the moment of discharge of the patients from the hospital, but non the less does not reduce the frequency of using homologous blood.
