Oral retinoids for the prevention of skin cancers in solid organ transplant recipients: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effects of using oral retinoids to prevent skin cancers in recipients of solid organ transplants. The authors concluded that limited data from a few small studies suggest that acitretin may prevent new skin cancers, but the drug is poorly tolerated. This was a well-conducted review and the authors' cautious conclusions reflect the limited evidence.
