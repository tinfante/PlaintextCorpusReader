Continuous positive airway pressure therapy for treating sleepiness in a diverse population with obstructive sleep apnea: results of a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to treat sleepiness in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea was limited by the diverse nature of the available trials. The review findings indicate that CPAP appears effective in patients with severe sleep apnoea and significant sleepiness, but data are less reliable for less severely affected patients; in these patients CPAP is probably not effective.
