Results of a pilot intervention trial to improve antiretroviral adherence among HIV-positive patients.
A small pilot trial of a multicomponent (behavioral strategies, simplified patient information, and social support) and multidisciplinary (cognitive-behavioral therapy and nursing) medication adherence intervention was conducted for HIV-infected adults prescribed antiretrovirals. Patients (N = 33) were randomly assigned to the intervention condition or standard care. Compared to the control group, patients in the intervention condition had significantly higher self-efficacy to communicate with clinic staff (p = .04) and to continue treatment (p = .04), were significantly more likely to be using behavioral and cognitive strategies (p = .01 and p = .04), reported significantly higher life satisfaction (p = .03), reported significantly increased feelings of social support (p = .04), and showed a trend toward an increase in taking their medications on schedule (p = .06). The intervention, however, did not appear to affect health-related anxiety or to significantly improve adherence to dose. Implications for future intervention planning are discussed.
