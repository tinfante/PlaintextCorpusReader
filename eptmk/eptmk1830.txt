Antibiotic irrigation prophylaxis in the high-risk cesarean section patient.
Two hundred twenty-three women who underwent cesarean section delivery were studied to assess the effectiveness of operative antibiotic irrigation in preventing postoperative uterine infection. Patients were prospectively randomized into high-risk and low-risk groups according to length of labor, and received irrigation with either a 2 gm solution of cefamandole or normal saline solution, or no irrigation. Infection rates of 48.6% and 54.8% were observed in high-risk patients given either saline solution or no irrigation, respectively. Three of 27 high-risk patients (11.1%) given antibiotic irrigation developed metritis. The authors find this method of preventing infection to be advantageous in terms of both efficacy and minimization of antibiotic exposure.
