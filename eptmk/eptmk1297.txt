Evaluating the Pegasus Trinova: a data hierarchy approach.
Understanding the efficacy of patient support surfaces is essential if pressure sore management is to be both efficient and effective. However, laboratory and clinical studies in this area are fraught with well recognized problems. This investigation reports a combination of laboratory, randomized controlled trial (efficacy data) and measures of effectiveness to illustrate the beneficial role of a new dynamic integrated mattress and seat cushion system: the Pegasus Trinova. Successful prevention of sores among a vulnerable patient population, along with positive comments regarding the system's comfort and 'user-friendliness' are supported by laboratory measures of interface pressure to provide a hierarchy of data. Such an approach may present one solution to the lack of timeliness of most mattress clinical trials, thus allowing decisions regarding new support surfaces to be made upon the basis of evidence, not on anecdote or solely upon marketing claims.
