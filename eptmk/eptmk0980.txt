Trichophyton-rubrum-infected toenails treated with ketoconazole and partial nail avulsion.
30 patients with totally 178 toenails infected with Trichophyton rubrum were randomly treated with ketoconazole alone for 4 months (group A) or in combination with chemical nail avulsion (group B). Of the 14 patients in group A who completed the treatment, 4 (28%) were cured 6 months later, compared to 8 (53%) of 15 patients in group B. In 4 cases, transient elevated hepatofunction enzymes occurred. Gastrointestinal disturbances caused withdrawal in 1 case.
