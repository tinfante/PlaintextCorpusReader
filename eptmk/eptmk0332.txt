A randomized controlled trial of an automated telephone intervention to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.
A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of an automated telephone intervention on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. One hundred twenty participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group that received a daily, automated telephone message regarding diabetes or to a control group that received usual care. The treatment group demonstrated a significant improvement in the frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose levels compared with the control group (P < .001). A favorable trend in positive attitudes toward diabetes and a reduction in perceived monitoring and exercise barriers were seen in the intervention group compared with the control group.
