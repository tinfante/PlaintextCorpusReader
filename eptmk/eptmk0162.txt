Mechanical prophylaxis of venous thrombosis in patients undergoing craniotomy: a randomized trial.
A randomized, prospective clinical trial of 70 patients undergoing craniotomy was performed to compare and evaluate two forms of mechanical prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis. Thirty-eight patients received antiembolism stockings, whereas 32 patients received external pneumatic compression. Prophylaxis was begun preoperatively and continued intraoperatively and post-operatively until the patients were ambulatory. Impedance plethysmography was used to detect deep vein thrombosis both preoperatively and postoperatively. Two patients, one from each group, developed thromboembolic complications postoperatively. Impedance plethysmography showed false-positive findings in two additional patients. There were no deaths. The data suggest that either form of mechanical prophylaxis is effective against the development of deep vein thrombosis in this high-risk patient population.
