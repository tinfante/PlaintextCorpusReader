Cost-effectiveness of eformoterol Turbohaler versus salmeterol Accuhaler in children with symptomatic asthma.
We conducted an economic evaluation in a UK setting based on a 12-week prospective randomized open-label parallel-group comparison of eformoterol Turbohaler 12 microg b. i.d. with salmeterol Accuhaler 50 microg b. i.d. in children aged 6-17 with symptomatic asthma receiving inhaled corticosteroids and short-acting beta2-agonists. The principal effectiveness measure was percentage of symptom-free days with no short-acting beta2-agonist use during the study period. Asthma-related medication, unscheduled physician contacts and hospitalizations were collected prospectively and cost to the UK NHS calculated using year 2,000 prices. The economic evaluation included 73 patients in the eformoterol group and 72 patients in the salmeterol group. The mean age of patients was 11.6 years (eformoterol) and 11.8 years (salmeterol). The mean percentage of symptom-free days with no short-acting beta2-agonist use was 39% in the eformoterol group and 30% in the salmeterol group. Mean per patient daily cost was 1.15 pounds in the eformoterol group and 1.39 pounds in the salmeterol group. Both cost and effectiveness differences favoured eformoterol (P < 0.05; one-sided). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the results to be robust to changes in effectiveness, price and resource utilisation parameters. Eformoterol delivered by Turbohaler was found to be significantly more effective and less expensive than salmeterol Accuhaler in this study.
