Systematic review of adverse outcomes of external cephalic version and persisting breech presentation at term
CRD SUMMARY: This review investigated the frequency of adverse maternal and foetal outcomes associated with external cephalic version in comparison with persisting breech presentation at term. The authors concluded that adverse outcomes are rare though, owing to poor reporting and methodological limitations, there was insufficient evidence to properly quantify adverse maternal and foetal outcomes. The authors' conclusions are appropriate.
