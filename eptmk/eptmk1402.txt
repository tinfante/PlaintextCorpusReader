Investigation of the use of drained blood reinfusion after total knee arthroplasty: a prospective randomised controlled study.
PURPOSE: To compare the use of a blood salvage and reinfusion system with standard allogeneic blood transfusion after total knee arthroplasty--a procedure associated with significant postoperative blood loss. METHODS: Between June 2002 and May 2004, 60 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly allocated into a reinfusion group (n = 26) or a control group (n = 34). Patients in the reinfusion group had their blood reinfused from drains within 6 hours of surgery. Both groups received allogeneic blood transfusions according to specified transfusion criteria if the haemoglobin level fell below 90 g/l, or in the presence of severe anaemic symptoms. Haemoglobin levels and drain output were recorded daily for 3 consecutive days after surgery. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in demographic data, drain output, total blood loss, and mean postoperative haemoglobin levels. Significantly more allogeneic blood was required by the control group than by the reinfusion group (p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Postoperative reinfusion of drained blood reduced the need for blood transfusion after total knee arthroplasty, while having an effect on postoperative haemoglobin level equivalent to standard allogeneic blood transfusion.
