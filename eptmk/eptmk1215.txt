Characteristics of antenatal care attenders in a rural population in Tamil Nadu, South India: a community-based cross-sectional study.
The objectives of the study were to identify factors associated with utilisation of antenatal care facilities in a rural population in South India. A community-based, cross-sectional questionnaire study of 30 randomly selected areas was used. A total of 1254 women (95%) had at least one antenatal care visit. The median number of visits was four. High utilisation of antenatal care facilities was associated with low parity and adverse obstetrical history, short distance to healthcare facilities and literacy. It was concluded that antenatal care coverage was high. Information about the above few aspects can be used to target women who are at risk of getting inadequate antenatal care.
