Gastrin concentrations in serum and gastric mucosa in patients with pernicious anaemia.
Sessile polyps in the antrum were found in 12 of 51 patients with pernicious anaemia. During gastroscopy, mucosal biopsies for gastrin determination were taken from the antrum and fundus and from the polyps. Patients with high gastrin concentration in the antral mucosa showed high serum gastrin concentrations, while most patients with low antral gastrin concentrations also had low serum gastrin values. On an average, the gastrin concentrations in the antrum were approximately 10 times, and those in the fundus approximately 100 times, higher than the corresponding values obtained in a reference group. The gastrin content in the polyps was not different from that in the surrounding antral mucosa. This study suggests that the polyps are not due to a functional hypertrophy of the antral mucosa caused by locally increased production of gastrin.
