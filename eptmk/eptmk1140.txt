Effects of cabbage leaf extract on breast engorgement.
The effectiveness of cabbage leaf extract was compared with that of a placebo in treating breast engorgement in lactating women. In a double-blind experiment with a pretest/posttest design, 21 participants received a cream containing cabbage leaf extract, while 18 received placebo cream. The placebo group received equal relief to the treated group, with the two groups showing no difference on all outcome measures. However, mothers perceived both creams to be effective in relieving discomfort. Feeding had a greater effect than the application of cream on relieving discomfort and decreasing tissue hardness. It is therefore recommended that lactation consultants encourage mothers to breastfeed if possible to relieve the discomfort of breast engorgement.
