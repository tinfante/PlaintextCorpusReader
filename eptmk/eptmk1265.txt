Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for resectable esophageal carcinoma: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that the overall survival rate, local-regional recurrence and postoperative mortality of patients with resectable oesophageal adenocarcinoma may be improved by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, with no apparent increase in the complication rate.  Overall, these findings appear to be supported by the data presented, although there is some risk that relevant data may have been missed.
