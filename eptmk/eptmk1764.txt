[Comparative efficacy and tolerance of fluvoxamine and amitriptyline in the treatment of moderate and severe depression in mental hospital]
The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and tolerance of fluvoxamine (FL) and amitriptyline (AM) in the treatment of patients hospitalized for moderate and severe depression and to evaluate the spectrum of antidepressive activity in FL. The study was open, randomized and comparative. Sixty patients (mean age 41 +/- 2.9 years) diagnosed as having recurrent depressive disorder, a moderate or severe depressive episode (ICD-10 F33.1, F33.2) were divided into two equal groups treated with FL or AM. The efficacies of FL and AM were comparable, with AM exhibiting an earlier clinical effect and FL having a better tolerance. FL was defined as an antidepressant with the predominantly sedative effect comparable to that of AM, but being better tolerated.
