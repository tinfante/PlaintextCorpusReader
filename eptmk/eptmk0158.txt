Clean indoor air: advances in California, 1990-1999.
OBJECTIVES: This study assessed progress in achieving clean indoor air in California. METHODS: Data were from large, cross-sectional population-based surveys (1990-1999). RESULTS: Indoor workers reporting smoke-free workplaces increased from 35.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 33.7, 36.3) in 1990 to 93.4% (95% CI = 92.6, 94.2) in 1999. Exposure of nonsmoking indoor workers to secondhand tobacco smoke decreased from 29.0% (95% CI = 27.2, 30.8) to 15.6% (95% CI = 14.1, 17.1). Adults with smoke-free homes increased from 37.6 % (95% CI = 35.1, 40.1) in 1992 to 73.7% (95% CI = 73.2, 74.2) in 1999; nearly half of smokers in 1999 had smoke-free homes. In 1999, 82.2% (95% CI = 81.5, 82.9) of children and adolescents (0-17 years) had smoke-free homes, up from 38.0% (95% CI = 35.1, 40.9) in 1992. CONCLUSIONS: California's advances highlight an important opportunity for tobacco control.
