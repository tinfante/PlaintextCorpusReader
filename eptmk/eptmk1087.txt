Cognitive-behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa: an empirical analysis of clinical significance
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that the results obtained for the clinical significance of cognitive-behavioural therapy were mixed and further research is required. The data appear to support the authors' conclusions, but it is difficult to assess the reliability of the conclusions given the limited search, poor reporting of review methods, and absence of a quality assessment.
