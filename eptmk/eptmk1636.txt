Azithromycin, erythromycin and cloxacillin in the treatment of infections of skin and associated soft tissues. European Azithromycin Study Group.
Azithromycin (total dose 1.5 g) given orally in five or six doses over 5 days was compared with erythromycin and cloxacillin both given orally as 500 mg four times daily for 7 days in two multicentre studies of patients with skin and associated soft-tissue infections. Azithromycin eradicated baseline pathogen(s), mainly Staphylococcus aureus, in 89% compared with in 78%, of erythromycin-treated patients (P = 0.501) and in 78% compared with in 59% of cloxacillin-treated patients (P = 0.421). No statistically significant difference in clinical cure was reported between azithromycin (74%) and erythromycin (75%, P = 1.00) and between azithromycin (60%) and cloxacillin (47%, P = 0.301) treatment groups. The side-effects reported for azithromycin were mainly mild or moderate gastro-intestinal complaints and there were no major abnormalities in laboratory parameters. It is concluded that azithromycin was as effective as, but better tolerated than, either erythromycin or cloxacillin and short-course therapy may improve patient compliance.
