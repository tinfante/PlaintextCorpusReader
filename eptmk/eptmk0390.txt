Fragmin once or twice daily subcutaneously in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis of the leg.
In an open, randomised controlled study, 101 patients with phlebographically diagnosed deep vein thrombosis of the leg, not extending into more than two thirds of the femoral vein, were randomised to receive Fragmin (a low molecular weight heparin) administered subcutaneously either once or twice daily in doses of 200 U(anti-FXa)/kg/24h or 100 U(anti-FXa)/kg/12h respectively. Prior to Fragmin unfractionated heparin had been administered by continuous iv infusion for not longer than 24h. Warfarin was administered from the first treatment day. Fragmin was administered for at least 5 days or until the prothrombin complex had been within the therapeutic range for at least 2 days. Patients were kept in bed for the first day but thereafter were ambulant. Phlebography was repeated at 5-7 days. Comparison of the phlebograms revealed a similar improvement (reduction in Marder score) in both groups. There were 5 cases of bleeding: 1 major and 3 minor in the twice daily group and 1 minor bleed in the once daily group. There were no cases of clinical pulmonary embolism. It is concluded that Fragmin, administered as a single daily subcutaneous injection, is effective in the treatment of deep vein thromboses, and offers the advantages of reduced costs, despite higher price of the drug, including reduced nursing time.
