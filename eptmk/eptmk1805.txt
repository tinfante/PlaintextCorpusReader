A 3-year clinical trial of the effect on dental caries of a dentifrice containing 2% sodium monoflurophosphate.
A clinical trial of a dentifrice containing 2% sodium monofluorophosphate was carried out on 782 schoolchildren in Shropshire, England. After 3 years, a reduction of 23.8% was found in the DMFS increment obtained from clinical examination. The reduction was 38.8% using radiographs. The children were divided into three groups according to baseline DMFS. Those with a "medium" caries experience were found to benefit most from using the dentifrice. There was a difference in the effect on individual tooth sites; the approximal surfaces of the posterior teeth received the most benefit and the occlusal surfaces the least.
