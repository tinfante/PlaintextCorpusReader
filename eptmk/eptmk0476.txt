The effectiveness of psychodramatic techniques: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of psychodramatic techniques. The authors concluded that their findings appear to shed a positive light on the validity of psychodramatic techniques and they should be researched further and integrated into psychotherapy practice. The limited reporting of the included studies and methods used mean that these findings may not be reliable.
