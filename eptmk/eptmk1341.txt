Modulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis in hepatic resection: a randomized prospective control study using antithrombin III concentrates.
A randomized prospective control trial for determining the efficacy of antithrombin III concentrates in hepatic resection was performed using 24 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Thirteen patients were given antithrombin III concentrates (1,500 IU) immediately before operation, during hepatectomy and immediately after operation. Coagulant and fibrinolytic profiles were determined by molecular markers such as thrombin-antithrombin III complex and plasmin-alpha 2plasmin inhibitor complex. During hepatic resection, both hypercoagulability and mainly primary hyperfibrinolysis occurred. Regarding the effectiveness of antithrombin III concentrates, in the antithrombin III treatment group, only a significant lower incidence of positive soluble fibrin monomer complex at postoperative days 1 and 5 was found among all the parameters studied. Therefore, no definite evidence of clinical usefulness of the perioperative administration of antithrombin III concentrates in hepatic resection was proved.
