Psychological impact of structured treatment interruptions in patients with prolonged undetectable HIV-1 viral loads.
Structured treatment interruption strategies may help overcome problems of highly active antiretroviral therapy, but might also represent a cause of stress. We present data that indicate a psychological benefit from structured treatment interruption. Although some disturbances appear at the resumption of therapy, no definitive problems are found that preclude such therapeutic approaches from a psychological perspective. However, a close follow-up of patients during interruption periods is advisable to avoid difficulties reported at treatment resumption presenting a risk to patients' health.
