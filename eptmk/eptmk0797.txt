OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of estradiol vaginal tablet with conjugated estrogen cream on urogenital symptoms, vaginal health index, vaginal cytology, endometrial thickness, and plasma estradiol level in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: Fifty-three women with urogenital symptoms were randomized to local vaginal treatment of 25 microg estradiol tablet or 1 g of conjugated estrogen cream for 12 weeks. They were assessed for urogenital symptoms, vaginal health index, vaginal cytology, endometrial thickness and estradiol level.
RESULTS: Forty-eight women completed the treatment. Both groups showed improvement of urogenital symptoms, vaginal health index, and vaginal cytology after the first 4 weeks of treatment. Conjugated estrogen cream showed superior efficacy in alleviating vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Two cases of endometrial proliferation were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Estradiol vaginal tablet and conjugated estrogen cream were effective in treating urogenital symptoms, the restoration of normal vaginal epithelium and reduction of vaginal pH in postmenopausal women. However, 2 cases of endometrial proliferation were noted.
