A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing n-butyl cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive (LiquiBand) with sutures for skin closure after laparoscopic general surgical procedures.
The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of n-butyl-cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive (Liquiband) with nonabsorbable monofilament sutures for laparoscopic port site closure. Adult patients having elective laparoscopic procedures were randomly allocated to wound closure with sutures or tissue adhesive. End points included skin closure time, wound dressing requirements, wound complications, and cosmesis, assessed at discharge, 4 to 6 weeks and 3 months. Seventy-eight patients randomized to receive sutures and 76 to receive tissue adhesive were eligible for final analysis. Mean closure time was significantly longer for sutures (220 vs. 125 s, P < 0.001). Fewer dressings were required in the tissue adhesive group immediately postoperatively (21% vs. 97%, P < 0.001) and at discharge (24% vs. 82%, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in wound complications or in cosmesis at either 4 to 6 weeks or at 3 months. Tissue adhesive for laparoscopic port site closure offers potential savings with respect to time and has comparable wound complication rates and cosmetic outcomes when compared with nonabsorbable monofilament sutures.
