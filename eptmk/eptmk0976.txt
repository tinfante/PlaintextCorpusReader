Low-molecular-weight heparin vs. unfractionated heparin in percutaneous coronary intervention: a combined analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared the use of low molecular weight heparin with unfractionated heparin in people undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. It concluded that the effects on clinical events (death, myocardial infarction or revascularisation) and on bleeding outcomes were similar with both treatments. There was little detail about the methods of the review, but the conclusions appear suitably cautious.
