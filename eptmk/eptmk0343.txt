High- v low-dose quetiapine in schizophrenia: meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The review concluded that high-dose quetiapine was not superior to low doses in the acute treatment of schizophrenia, both in terms of efficacy and effectiveness. In light of the absence of an assessment of trial quality and the limited follow-up periods of the included trials, the author's conclusion should be interpreted with a degree of caution.
