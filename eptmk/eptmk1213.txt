Impact of report cards on employees: a natural experiment.
To determine the effect of survey-based, health plan report cards on employees as they selected their 1995 health plan, the authors surveyed two groups of Minnesota State employees, one of which received the report card and one that did not. Both groups were surveyed before and after their enrollment. The authors looked for report card effects on relative changes in the employees' knowledge of health plan benefits and their ratings of quality and cost attributes, as well as their plan choice, rates of switching plans, and willingness to pay higher premiums. The only report card effect found was an increase in perceived knowledge for employees with single coverage.
