Control of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the effectiveness of treatments for acute bleeding in patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors. The authors concluded that bleeding control varied from 60 to 100%. The authors undertook a systematic search but the lack of detail on review methodology and the poor quality of many included studies make the reliability of the conclusions uncertain.
