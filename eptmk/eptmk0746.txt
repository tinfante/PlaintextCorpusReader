Comparison of the efficacy of the tumour necrosis factor alpha blocking agents adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab when added to methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab when added to methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. The authors concluded that the three agents have similar efficacy when combined with methotrexate. Overall, the methods of analysis may mean that the trials were not powered to detect any true treatment effect differences. Head-to-head comparisons between the three drugs are therefore warranted.
