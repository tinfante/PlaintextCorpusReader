Adolescents having obesity surgery: a 6-year follow-up.
Thirty-four adolescents aged 11 to 19 at the time of gastric surgery for obesity were interviewed an average of 6 years postoperatively. Patients' preoperative body mass index averaged 47; at follow-up, their body mass index averaged 32. Two thirds of the patients weighed within 9 kg of their lowest postsurgical weight at the time of follow-up; three had had additional obesity surgery. Patients reported excellent psychosocial adjustment, including improved self-esteem, social relationships, and appearance. No patient was unemployed. Patients reported poor compliance with exercise and dietary instructions. More seriously, only four patients reported taking vitamin B12, multivitamin supplements, and calcium as directed. The need for long-term patient commitment and monitoring is discussed.
