Hemostasis and cold knife cone biopsy: a prospective randomized trial comparing a suture versus non-suture technique.
Two methods of obtaining hemostasis after cold knife cone biopsy were compared in a prospective randomized trial involving 200 patients. One method relied primarily on hemostatic sutures, and the other involved the use of a styptic solution (Monsel's solution) and vaginal pack, thus avoiding the use of sutures altogether. The short- and long-term morbidity in these two groups were compared and 12-month follow-up was completed. The use of sutures did not reduce the incidence of primary hemorrhage. Secondary hemorrhage was twice as frequent in the suture group, although this trend did not quite reach statistical significance. During long-term follow-up, significantly more patients in the suture group developed menstrual symptoms, cervical stenosis, and unsatisfactory colposcopy, requiring further operative intervention as a result.
