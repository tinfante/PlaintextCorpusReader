Relative efficacy of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in the treatment of depression: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that psychotherapy and pharmacology appear to be equally efficacious for depression in the short-term, but psychotherapy is associated with lower relapse rates at follow-up. The conclusions regarding the similar short-term efficacy of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy appear reliable, but limitations of the follow-up data suggest that the conclusions about longer term effects might not be definitive.
