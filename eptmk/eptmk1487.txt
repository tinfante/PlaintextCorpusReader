The reliability of clinical examination in detecting pelvic fractures in blunt trauma patients: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that clinical examination is able to detect relevant fractures of the pelvis, and that fractures that are missed tend not to require immediate treatment. Although these findings appear reliable, they should be interpreted with some degree of caution given the possibility of publication bias, differences between the studies and the failure to adequately assess study quality.
