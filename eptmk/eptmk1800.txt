Clinical trial of a low-fluoride toothpaste for young children.
In this double-blind trial, the anticaries effectiveness of a test toothpaste formulated for young children with 550 ppm F was compared with that of a positive control toothpaste containing 1055 ppm fluoride. More than 3000 2-year-old children were enrolled in the study and after 3 years of toothpaste use, 2177 (72 per cent) were examined. From a clinical and radiographic assessment, more than half the children were found to be caries free and only 32 (1.5 per cent) had evidence of rampant caries. There appeared to be little or no difference between children who had used test or control pastes, either in caries or in plaque levels. On the basis of this clinical trial the experimental toothpaste with 550 ppm fluoride would appear to have a similar anticaries efficacy to that of the control toothpaste. Differences were seen in relation to sex of the child and to social class. Girls had lower levels of plaque than boys but more carious teeth. Children from families in higher social classes had fewer carious teeth and lower levels of plaque.
