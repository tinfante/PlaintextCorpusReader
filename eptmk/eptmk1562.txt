Meta-analysis of 5-year outcomes of CABG vs PCI with stenting in patients with multivessel disease
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that there was no survival benefit for coronary artery bypass grafting over percutaneous coronary artery intervention five years after initial procedure. Major adverse cardiovascular events and repeat revascularisation were higher after percutaneous coronary artery intervention. The conclusions reflected the evidence, but without validity assessment and reporting on other review processes the reliability of the conclusions is unclear.
