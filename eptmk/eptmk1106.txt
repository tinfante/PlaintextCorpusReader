Relative thromboembolic risks associated with COX-2 inhibitors
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that celecoxib was the safest cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor when given in the lowest possible dose. The limited search, inadequate reporting of review methods, lack of a quality assessment of the included studies, and reliance upon data from observational studies to compare drugs mean that any conclusions might not be reliable.
