CRD SUMMARY: This review compared the efficacy of different proton-pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole) in standard triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication. The authors concluded that there appears to be no difference in the efficacy of different proton-pump inhibitors. The authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable.
