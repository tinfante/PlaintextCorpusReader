Prevention of ventricular fibrillation during acute myocardial infarction by intravenous propranolol.
A trial of intravenous followed by oral propranolol, started within 4 h of onset of suspected myocardial infarction and continued over 27 h, was carried out in 735 patients; 364 received propranolol, 371 were controls. Ventricular fibrillation during the first 48 h after entry to the trial occurred in 2 treated patients and in 14 controls (p = 0.006). Rates of hospital mortality, complications other than ventricular fibrillation, and progression from threatened to completed infarction did not differ between treated and control patients. Ventricular fibrillation was not apparently prevented by prior beta-blocker treatment, which was not a reason for exclusion from the trial. This intravenous/oral propranolol regimen seems to prevent ventricular fibrillation due to evolving myocardial infarction.
