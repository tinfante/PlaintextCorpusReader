Systematic review: comparing routine and selective invasive strategies for the acute coronary syndrome
CRD SUMMARY: This reasonably well-conducted review assessed the efficacy of a routine invasive strategy compared with a selective invasive strategy on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with non-ST-segment elevated acute coronary syndrome. The authors' conclusion, that the current evidence does not clearly support the superiority of a routine invasive strategy over a selective invasive strategy in terms of the risk of mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction, is likely to be reliable.
