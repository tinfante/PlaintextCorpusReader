New generation antipsychotics versus low-potency conventional antipsychotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed whether new-generation antipsychotic drugs cause fewer extra-pyramidal side effects (EPS) than low-potency conventional antipsychotics. The authors concluded that new-generation drugs might cause EPS equivalent to optimum doses of conventional treatments, and that these drugs might be more effective than conventional treatments. This was a well-conducted review which pointed to the need for further trials in this area.
