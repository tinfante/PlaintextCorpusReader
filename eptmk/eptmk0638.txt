Once-weekly fluconazole to prevent recurrence of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex: a double-blind placebo-controlled study.
Fluconazole 50 mg daily for 14-28 days was effective in the treatment of patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex with severe oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis. Of 24 patients entered, 17 (81%), including seven with oesophageal candidiasis, were clinically cured and two (9.5%) improved at the end of treatment. Following clinical cure, 14 patients were entered into the double-blind phase of the study, where fluconazole (150 mg) or placebo capsules were given once weekly. Treatment was double blind. Fluconazole 150 mg once weekly was found to be effective in maintaining patients both clinically and mycologically free of oropharyngeal candidiasis.
