APC-resistance is a risk factor for postoperative thromboembolism in elective replacement of the hip or knee--a prospective study.
Postoperative venous thromboembolic complications are commonly seen after total replacement of the hip or knee. Recently, an inherited defect with resistance to the anticoagulant activity of activated protein C (APC-resistance) has been detected. APC-resistance seems to be a common risk factor, especially in Sweden, and it increases the propensity for venous thrombosis. This study assesses the prevalence of APC-resistance in a general population and its clinical significance for patients undergoing surgery associated with a high risk of thromboembolic complications. In a prospective cohort study, we analysed for APC-resistance in 645 consecutive patients before elective replacement of the hip or knee at 3 hospitals in southern Sweden. Thromboprophylaxis with LMWH-heparin was given to all patients throughout the hospitalisation period. We recorded events of clinical thromboembolism for 3 months postoperatively. Venography, ultrasonography or pulmonary scintigraphy was requested by the clinicians according to the existing routines, i.e. only patients with symptoms of thromboembolism were examined. A thromboembolic complication was registered in 20 (3.1%) patients. Fifty per cent of the venous thrombi had a proximal location. Only 0.3% of the patients had verified pulmonary embolism. APC-resistance was found in 14.1% of the patients, of whom 9.9% had experienced postoperative thromboembolism compared with 2.0% of the patients without APC-resistance (p<0.0007). We conclude that APC-resistance is a frequent risk factor for symptomatic postoperative deep venous thrombosis with an estimated relative risk of 5.0 (95% confidence interval: from 1.9 to 12.9) in elective replacement of the hip or knee.
