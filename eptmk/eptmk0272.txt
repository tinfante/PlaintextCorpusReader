Obstetrical prognosis and pregnancy outcome following pelvic arterial embolisation for post-partum hemorrhage
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that pelvic arterial embolisation offered a safe and conservative alternative to surgical intervention for post-partum haemorrhage in women who desired to preserve future fertility. As this did not appear to be a systematic review and the evidence was from retrospective studies and case reports, these conclusions need to be considered with caution.
