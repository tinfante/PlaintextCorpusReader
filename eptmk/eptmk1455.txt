A double-blind, vehicle-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of Fungoid Tincture in patients with distal subungual onychomycosis of the toes.
Onychomycosis is one of the most common causes of nail disease and one of the hardest to treat among fungal infections. A double-blind, vehicle-controlled study has been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fungoid Tincture (Pedinol Pharmacal, Inc), for the treatment of fungal infection of the toenails. Ten patients with distal subungual onychomycosis were treated for twelve months with topical Fungoid Tincture. Another ten patients with the same ailment were treated with the vehicle alone. Once a month, clinical and global evaluation of the target nail was done, in addition to trimming and debridement of the nails. After twelve months of treatment, 90 percent of patients applying Fungoid Tincture showed negative results on culture. There were minimal adverse effects.
