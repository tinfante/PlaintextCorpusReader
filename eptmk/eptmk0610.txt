Formoterol and beclomethasone versus higher dose beclomethasone as maintenance therapy in adult asthma.
A total of 132 adult asthmatics who were symptomatic on 500 microg x day(-1) inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) were studied in an open-label randomized, parallel group, 12 week, clinical trial. The addition of 12 microg formoterol fumarate solution aerosol (pressurized metered dose inhaler) b.i.d. to BDP at a dose of 500 microg x day(-1) was compared with a higher dose of 1,000 microg x day(-1) BDP. Mean morning premedication peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) during the final week of treatment (primary end-point) increased in both groups compared to baseline. The estimated treatment difference of 20.4 L x min(-1) (95% confidence interval 3.2-37.6) after 12 weeks of treatment was statistically significant (p<0.05) in favour of the formoterol/BDP group. The overall mean morning premedication PEF for the entire treatment period was higher in the formotero/BDP group (p=0.002). The overall number of puffs of rescue medication and asthma symptom scores were less in the formotero/BDP group (p<0.01). Safety and tolerability evaluations were satisfactory in both groups. In conclusion, the results suggest that the addition of formoterol fumarate to the existing dose of an inhaled corticosteroid should be considered as an alternative to increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid in the inadequately controlled asthmatic.
