The effect of tai chi on health outcomes in patients with chronic conditions: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effects of t'ai chi on patients with chronic medical conditions. The authors concluded that t'ai chi appears to have physiological and psychosocial benefits, but well-designed studies are required. Given that the studies were generally of a poor quality and methodological details of the review process were absent, the conclusions about efficacy should be treated with caution.
