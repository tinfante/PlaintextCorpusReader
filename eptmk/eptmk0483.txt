Efficacy of postoperative epidural analgesia
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the efficacy of post-operative epidural analgesia. The authors concluded that epidural analgesia (with the exception of thoracic epidural analgesia with opioids for thoracic surgery) was associated with significantly better post-operative analgesia than parental opioids. However, limitations in the review process and an inappropriate analysis mean that the conclusions cannot be considered reliable.
