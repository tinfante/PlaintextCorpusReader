Treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations: a systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The authors of this review noted a decrease in mortality over time, but stated that treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations remained associated with considerable risks and incomplete efficacy. They recommended that randomised controlled trials should be conducted to compare different treatments for the condition. This recommendation appears appropriate given that the review located only observational studies (which cannot determine causality).
