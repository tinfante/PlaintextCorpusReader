Community-based service use among the young, middle, and old old.
The study purpose was to determine differences in number, type, and predictors of community-based service use among elders in three age groups. Existing data from a regional Area Agency on Aging were used and the sample (n = 2,474) included vulnerable elders, men, African Americans, low income, and rural residents. Services most frequently used were case management, congregate meal, home-delivered meal, outreach, and recreation. Differences existed among the young, middle, and old old age groups in the number and types of services used. Race, residence, transportation capability, payment source, and function were the most frequent predictors of use.
