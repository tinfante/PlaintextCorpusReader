Effects of low-dose subcutaneous heparin on the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis in patients with ischemic stroke.
The effectiveness of low-dose subcutaneous heparin in the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis in patients with ischemic stroke was investigated in an unblinded controlled study. The frequency of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in the control group was 23% versus 2% in the patients receiving heparin. There were no bleeding complications in the test group and there were no differences in the occurrence of hemorrhage changes in the cerebral ischemic infarction in both groups.
