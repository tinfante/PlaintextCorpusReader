Primary care clinician attitudes towards ambulatory computerized physician order entry.
Ambulatory computerized physician order entry (ACPOE) represents one strategy to improve physician ordering practices, compliance with guidelines, and patient safety. We surveyed primary care physicians (PCPs) regarding attitudes towards ACPOE and its various features. Most PCPs did not have systems for tracking test results and were concerned about missed tests. However, there was concern that ACPOE might be time consuming, and only one-third of PCPs felt that ACPOE features would be very useful. Speed and workflow issues will be important contributors to the success of ACPOE. In addition, physician buy-in to the utility of its various features will need to be strengthened.
