[Efficacy and acceptability of tianeptine and sertraline in the acute treatment phase of depression]
Efficacy and acceptability of tianeptine were investigated in a multicenter, randomized, double blind, and sertraline-controlled study. As a total, 212 in- or outpatients with DSM IV major depression single episode, recurrent and bipolar depression, were treated for 42 days either with tianeptine (37.5 mg) or with sertraline (50 mg). At inclusion, sociodemographic, physical and psychological parameters showed no significant intergroup differences. MADRS responders (50% reduction of baseline score) were 66% and 67% with tianeptine and sertraline, respectively. No statistical interdrug differences were observed either in the number of withdrawals or in the efficacy and acceptability parameters.
