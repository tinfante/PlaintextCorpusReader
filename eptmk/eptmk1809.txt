Comparison of the modified biophysical profile to a "new" biophysical profile incorporating the middle cerebral artery to umbilical artery velocity flow systolic/diastolic ratio.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether the addition of the middle cerebral to umbilical artery systolic/diastolic velocity waveform ratio to the modified biophysical profile would improve perinatal outcome in patients at high risk. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized outcome study of patients referred to the perinatal laboratory for antenatal surveillance was undertaken. Six hundred sixty-five patients were randomized to two antenatal surveillance protocols: group 1, modified biophysical profile; and group 2, modified biophysical profile plus evaluation of the middle cerebral artery to umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratio. Patients were followed up serially and neonatal outcome data including gestational age at delivery, birth weight, incidence of cesarean section delivery for fetal distress, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, days in the neonatal intensive care unit, and the presence of significant neonatal morbidity were tabulated. RESULTS: The total population showed no statistical difference in outcome parameters between groups 1 and 2. However, a subgroup of patients evaluated for suspected uteroplacental insufficiency did show a significant reduction in caesarean section for fetal distress in group 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a subgroup of patients at risk for uteroplacental insufficiency, the addition of the middle cerebral/umbilical artery ratio to an antenatal surveillance protocol should be expected to improve perinatal outcome.
