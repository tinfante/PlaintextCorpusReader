Stentless versus stented bioprosthetic aortic valves: a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared the effectiveness of stentless and stented bioprosthetic valves in patients who underwent aortic valve replacement. The authors concluded that stentless aortic valves improved short-term haemodynamic outcomes,. There was no evidence of impacts on patient morbidity, mortality and resource-related outcomes. Due to the unclear quality of included trials, some caution is warranted when interpreting the authors' conclusion
