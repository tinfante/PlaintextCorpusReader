Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis in high risk patients undergoing total hip replacement with low molecular weight heparin plus dihydroergotamine.
In 160 high risk patients with total hip replacement the antithrombotic efficacy and tolerance of a single daily injection of 1500 aPTT-U (aPTT = activated partial thromboplastin time) low molecular weight heparin plus 0.5 mg dihydroergotamine (HNMD; Embolex NM) was compared with a twice daily application of 5000 IU of the heparin-dihydroergotamine combination Heparin-Dihydergot in a double-blind study. Deep vein thrombosis measured by means of the radiofibrinogen uptake test occurred in 20.5% of patients in both groups. In addition, intra- and postoperative blood loss and the development of hematoma were similar in both groups. Thus, on account of the "once-daily" application HNMD offers some substantial advantages: The stress of the patient in the postoperative convalescence phase can be appreciably lowered and thereby the nursing staff are spared a great deal of work.
