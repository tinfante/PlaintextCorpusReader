Randomized controlled study of heparin and low molecular weight heparin for prevention of deep-vein thrombosis in medical patients.
166 patients aged 40-80 years were included in a controlled, randomized, double-blind study to determine the efficacy and safety of a single daily injection of a low molecular weight (LMW) heparin for prevention of deep-vein thrombosis compared to low dose conventional heparin. Patients received 1 x 1.500 aPTT units of a LMW heparin fraction (plus 2 x placebo injection) or 3 x 5.000 IU of an unfractionated heparin. During 10 days of treatment, patients underwent repeated clinical investigation, serial impedance plethysmography, and Doppler sonography for detection of thrombosis of the lower limbs. Combined application of these methods revealed evidence of thrombosis in 4.5% of patients on unfractionated heparin and 3.6% of patients on LMW heparin. Subcutaneous hematomas were significantly smaller in diameter upon treatment with LMW heparin (p less than 0.001). Antithrombin III levels were significantly higher at the end of the observation period in the LMW heparin group (p less than 0.005). Thrombocyte count, transaminases, creatinine, and haemoglobin did not change in either group. The results indicate that LMW heparin administered by a single s.c. dose daily may be as effective as low dose heparin in prevention of deep venous thrombosis in medical inpatients.
