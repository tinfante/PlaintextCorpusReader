Effect of statins in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery
CRD SUMMARY: Preoperative use of statins showed no statistically significant reduction in the occurrence of atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery, but more research is needed. Given the limitations of the included studies and the potential for some bias in the review, these findings should be interpreted with caution. The authors' recommendation for further research seems appropriate.
