A program in orientation and mobility for visually impaired persons over age 60
Describes the development of an assessment instrument and a training curriculum in orientation and mobility, to be used by families or friends of older blind and visually impaired adults, as well as by professionals in vision and related fields. A field test of the materials was conducted, using the assessment instrument in a pretest-posttest design, with the training curriculum and a structured control activity administered during intervention. A total of 35 Ss completed the program. Although the materials received enthusiastic support from the project's consultants and participants, no significant treatment or interaction effects were found.
