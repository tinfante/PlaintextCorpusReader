Mucositis incidence, severity and associated outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy: a systematic literature review
CRD SUMMARY: This well-conducted review examined the incidence of mucositis in patients treated with radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. The authors concluded that mucositis occurs frequently and severely, but that its overall impact on treatment outcomes has not been adequately investigated. The authors' conclusions are appropriate considering the paucity of evidence found for many relevant treatment outcomes.
