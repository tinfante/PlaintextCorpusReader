Implementation of clinical supervision in a medical department: nurses' views of the effects.
The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate nurses' views of the effects of clinical supervision in terms of its influence over their working situation, as well as their satisfaction with their working milieu. The nurses who took part in an education programme and a clinical supervision programme worked on two wards in a medical clinic. Nurses answered a questionnaire measuring the psychosocial environment. Data were analysed by means of descriptive statistics. Results showed that the nurses felt more confirmed in their work and more satisfied with the information given after 9 months of clinical supervision. Results point to the need for further investigations concerning clinical supervision as a method of achieving job satisfaction among nurses.
