A randomized comparison of polypropylene mesh surgery with site-specific surgery in the treatment of cystocoele.
The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of polypropylene mesh surgery with the site-specific repair surgeries in the treatment of cystocoeles. We randomized 90 patients into two groups according to a computer-based program. After a 12-month (mean) follow up, we noticed that the polypropylene mesh surgery yielded good anatomical results. Acceptable anatomical cure rates were 91 and 72% in the mesh surgery group and site-specific surgery group, respectively. There were three cases (6.9%) of mesh erosion. One case of urinary retention and two cases of de novo dyspareunia were seen in the mesh surgery group. De novo stress urinary incontinence developed in three patients in the site-specific surgery group. We concluded that surgery with light polypropylene mesh (Sofradim, Parietene) is superior to the site-specific surgery in the treatment of cystocoeles.
