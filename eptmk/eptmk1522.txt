Acute and maintenance effects of non-pharmacologic interventions for antipsychotic associated weight gain and metabolic abnormalities: a meta-analytic comparison of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that behavioural interventions (cognitive-behavioural therapy or nutrition and/or exercise interventions) effectively reduced weight gain associated with use of antipsychotic medication. The reliability of the authors' conclusions is uncertain due to a lack of study quality assessment, limits in the description of interventions and short follow-up times.
