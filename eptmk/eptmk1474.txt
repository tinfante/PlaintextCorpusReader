Management of treatment-resistant epilepsy. Volume 1: evidence report and appendices. Volume 2: evidence tables. Non-drug treatment strategies
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated non-drug treatments for patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy, and concluded that effective treatments are available, but all have disadvantages. Given the exclusion of several interventions, the paucity of good-quality data for those included, and the limitations of the review, the conclusions should be viewed with caution.
