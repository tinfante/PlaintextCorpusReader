Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention: a meta-analysis of randomized and nonrandomized studies.
We performed a meta-analysis of all studies comparing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (OPCABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with coronary artery disease. Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis and 4,821 patients were compared, of whom 3,450 patients underwent PCI and 1,371 patients underwent OPCABG. The rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality were similar. The 12-month rate of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events and need for repeat revascularization was significantly lower in the OPCABG group when compared with the PCI group.
