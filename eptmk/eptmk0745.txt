Comparison of the efficacy and acute toxicity of weekly versus daily chemoradiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This meta-analysis of 10 trials found that chemoradiotherapy had a small beneficial effect on death rate in people with inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer, but increased severe acute toxicity compared with radiotherapy alone. The results were not different for daily or weekly chemoradiotherapy. However, these general findings should be treated with caution because the primary studies differed in terms of tumour stage and treatment regimens.
