A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotics in patients with psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotics in patients with psychological and behavioural symptoms of dementia. The authors concluded that clinicians require more information for making decisions. The evidence presented appears to support the conclusions, but poor reporting of review methods makes it difficult to confirm the robustness of these conclusions.
