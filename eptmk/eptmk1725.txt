Calf compression for prevention of thromboembolism following hip surgery.
A prospective, randomized trial of the effect of graded compression of the calf was done in 62 patients operated on electively for hip disease. After total hip arthroplasty, compression reduced the number of positive fibrinogen uptake tests by two-thirds, significant only in males, who seem to run a higher risk of thrombosis than females.
