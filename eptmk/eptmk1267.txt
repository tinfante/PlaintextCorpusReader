The effects of reminiscence on psychological well-being in older adults: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that reminiscence in general and life review in particular were potentially effective interventions for the enhancement of psychological wellbeing in older adults, but further research was needed. However, given concerns about some aspects of the review methodology and the inclusion of variable quality studies with small sample sizes, the authors' conclusions should be viewed with caution.
