Effect of bladder filling on embryo transfer.
We have investigated a claim that bladder filling, by straightening an anteverted uterus into line with the vagina, might facilitate embryo transfer through the cervix after in vitro fertilization. In a randomized controlled trail in 66 women with and 76 without a filled bladder, we found no significant differences in difficulties encountered at embryo transfer or in the chance of pregnancy.
