A clinical trial of tissue adhesive (histoacryl) in skin closure of groin wounds.
The use of tissue adhesives has been widely studied since the 1960s. Since then they have found use in specialties like plastic surgery, neurosurgery, ENT surgery and dental surgery. Several papers have reported their safe use, both clinically and experimentally, particularly of the newer homologue n-butyl/2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl). In this study 43 patients (46 wounds) whose operations involved a groin incision were randomised into two groups for skin closure either with Dexon subcuticular suture (23 wounds) or Histoacryl glue (23 wounds). We found that both sets of wounds healed well with no wound infections or excessive inflammation when assessed at one week and four weeks. However the glued wounds had consistently better cosmesis scores (mean score 4.71 at four weeks) compared to the subcuticular Dexon wounds (mean score 4.00 at four weeks) and P value of less than 0.05. We feel that there is a place for tissue adhesives in skin closure for some general surgical wounds.
