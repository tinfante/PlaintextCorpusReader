Pre-induction intracervical application of a highly viscous prostaglandin E2 gel in pregnant women with an unripe uterine cervix: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
Intracervical application of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) gel has shown to be an effective method for pre-induction cervical ripening in pregnant women with an unripe uterine cervix. Side effects are minimal, provided that the instillation is carefully restricted to the cervical canal. This requires--apart from a proper technique--an optimal gel formulation. For this reason a newly developed highly viscous PGE2 gel was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial. Within a 9-h study period, successful cervical ripening (increase in Bishop score to 6 or more) was achieved in 39 (56%) of the 70 patients in the PGE2 groups and in 23 (34%) of the 68% patients in the placebo group (P = 0.04). During the first 12 h after gel application, 25 (35%) of the women in the PGE2 group and 2 (3%) in the placebo group had a spontaneous delivery. No serious adverse reactions were observed. The data suggest that the use of this highly viscous PGE2 gel may be advantageous if strictly intracervical application is the primary objective.
