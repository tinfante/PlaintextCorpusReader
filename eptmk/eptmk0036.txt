Puerperal thromboprophylaxis: comparison of the anti-Xa activity of enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin.
Low molecular weight heparins are used extensively for thromboprophylaxis. The aim of this study was to compare the activity of the low molecular weight heparin, enoxaparin, 20 mg and 40 mg, given once per day with unfractionated heparin, 7500iu given twice per day, in terms of their anti-Xa activity in puerperal women following caesarean section and with an additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism. Seventeen women were randomised to receive one of the three treatments. The anti-Xa activity associated with each treatment was measured prior to treatment and at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours. The mean anti-Xa values of the groups receiving enoxaparin, 20 mg and 40 mg, were significantly higher than those of the group receiving unfractionated heparin. There was no difference between the two enoxaparin groups in terms of the anti-Xa activity profiles. This study suggests that the use of enoxaparin is superior to unfractionated heparin in terms of anti-Xa activity.
