The efficacy of light therapy in the treatment of mood disorders: a review and meta-analysis of the evidence
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the efficacy of light therapy in adults with mood disorders. The authors concluded that bright light therapy and dawn simulation for seasonal affective disorder and bright light therapy for non-seasonal depression show evidence of efficacy. It was not possible to determine the reliability of these conclusions since the review had some substantial methodological limitations.
