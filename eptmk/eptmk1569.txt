Detection of pneumonia among children under six years by clinical evaluation.
To determine the most useful clinical symptoms and signs for detection of pneumonia in children, we carried out a prospective clinical study at Queen Alia Hospital, Amman, on 147 children admitted between August 2002 and January 2003 with clinical pneumonia. All the children had chest X-rays, which were read by the same radiologist. The most sensitive and specific signs and symptoms for prediction of pneumonia were coughing, tachypnoea (respiratory rate > 50/min) and chest wall indrawing. We found that presence of tachypnoea and lower chest wall indrawing can detect most cases of pneumonia. If all clinical signs are negative, chest X-ray findings are unlikely to be positive.
