Institutional arrangements and efficiency of health care delivery systems.
This study examined the efficiency of health care delivery systems in 24 OECD countries. Practicing physicians, practicing nurses, inpatient beds, and pharmaceuticals were considered as inputs to treat populations of various age groups. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was utilized to calculate efficiency. We also calculated input efficiency that should be helpful in determining excess number of physicians, nurses, inpatient beds, and pharmaceuticals consumed. Institutional arrangements affect efficiency: public-contract and public-integrated countries are more efficient than public-reimbursement countries. Countries in which physicians are paid in wages and salaries and countries with capitation have higher efficiency than fee-for-service countries. Countries in which a primary care physician acts as a gatekeeper are also more efficient than countries without gatekeepers.
