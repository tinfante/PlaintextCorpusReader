Thromboprophylaxis by low-molecular-weight heparin in elective hip surgery. A placebo controlled study.
In a double-blind, randomised study of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing total hip replacement, we compared a low-molecular-weight heparin with a placebo. Of the 120 patients enrolled, 112 completed the trial; 58 in the treatment group and 54 in the placebo group. Nine (16%) patients in the treatment group and 19 (35%) in the placebo group developed deep venous thrombosis, diagnosed by the 125I-fibrinogen uptake test (p < 0.02). Verification was obtained by phlebography in 86% of the patients. Prolonged surgery increased the risk of thrombosis in the placebo group but not in the treatment group (p < 0.05). There were significantly more cases of deep venous thrombosis in the placebo group during the first four postoperative days (p < 0.02). The groups did not differ with respect to peroperative and postoperative bleeding. Low-molecular-weight heparin offers safe and easily administered thromboprophylaxis in total hip replacement.
