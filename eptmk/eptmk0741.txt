Impact of an Electronic Health Record on oncologists' clinic time.
The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has been widely advocated to transform health-care delivery by improving quality, safety, and efficiency. Compared to a paper-based system, EHRs offer better access to clinical data and facilitate order entry and decision support. However, the benefits provided by EHRs do not eliminate the need to assess how such systems alter clinician time utilization. A major barrier to EHR use has been the concern that the EHR will take longer to use than paper-based systems. Few studies have addressed this issue in specialty clinic settings. We performed a time-motion study to evaluate how oncologists' time utilization differed before and after EHR implementation.
