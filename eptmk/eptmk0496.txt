Professional fluoride varnish treatment for caries control: a systematic review of clinical trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review aimed to evaluate the effect of professional fluoride varnish treatments on caries prevention. The authors concluded that there is limited evidence that professional fluoride varnish treatment has a caries-preventive effect in permanent teeth in children and adolescents. Evidence in adults and children with primary dentition was inconclusive. The results were inconsistent across studies and this weakened the evidence.
