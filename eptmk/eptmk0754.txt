Contemporary surgical treatment of epistaxis: what is the evidence for sphenopalatine artery ligation?
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed sphenopalatine artery ligation (SAL) and compared it with other techniques for the treatment of nosebleeds. The authors concluded that endoscopic transnasal SAL may be the best surgical treatment for posterior epistaxis. Treatments were not compared directly and evidence for comparison treatments was not selected systematically, hence the conclusions may not be reliable.
