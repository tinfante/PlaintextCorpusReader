Morbidity in pediatric tonsillectomy.
Tonsillectomy is one of the most common operations performed in the pediatric age group. Previous literature on morbidity in tonsillectomy has dealt predominantly with postoperative hemorrhage. Children undergoing tonsillectomy were divided in a prospective and random fashion into eight study groups to evaluate postoperative morbidity as it relates to the surgical technique used (electrocautery, dissection, KTP laser), methods of hemostasis (electrocautery, suture ligature), and the use of postoperative antibiotics. A total of 80 children were evaluated. Using the parameters of morbidity as defined in this study, blunt dissection tonsillectomy using suture ligatures for hemostasis, without postoperative antibiotics was found to result in the least morbidity in the pediatric age group.
