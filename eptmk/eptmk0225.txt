Prostate cancer and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This meta-analysis of 12 observational studies found that aspirin reduces the risk of prostate cancer, especially advanced cancers. The effect of other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was less certain. The methods of analysis appeared appropriate, but the authors did not report methods to assess study relevance or validity. There was limited information on drug doses, which may limit clinical application of the findings.
