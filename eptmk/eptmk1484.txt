Recurrence rates of video-assisted thoracoscopic versus open surgery in the prevention of recurrent pneumothoraces: a systematic review of randomised and non-randomised trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared the efficacy of video-assisted and open surgery for the prevention of recurrent pneumothorax. The authors concluded that the video-assisted approach was associated with a four-fold higher rate of recurrent pneumothorax. This review was well-conducted and the conclusions appear reliable.
