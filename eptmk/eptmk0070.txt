A meta-analysis of pain response in the treatment of fibromyalgia
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that eight active treatments showed evidence of an improvement in pain over placebo in patients with fibromyalgia. Indirect comparison of active treatments found no strong differences. These conclusions should be interpreted with caution in view of the risk of publication bias and the small number of included studies for each comparison.
