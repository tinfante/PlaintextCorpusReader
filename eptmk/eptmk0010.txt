KTP-Laser and fibrin glue for treatment of fistulae in ano.
Fistulae-in-ano remains a significant surgical problem due to the limitations pertinent to accurate assessment and the magnitude, shortcomings and side effects of the various procedures currently employed for their management. Six consecutive fistulae-in-ano patients (males, age range 30 to 58 years) were successfully treated by KTP laser (20-watt continuous aim for 20 to 30 seconds delivering a total energy of 400 to 600 joules) with rapid solidification fibrin glue then followed up for 3 months without recurrence. This approach offers a simple, expeditious and effective treatment for fistulae-in-ano thereby overcoming many of the restrictions associated with other methods.
