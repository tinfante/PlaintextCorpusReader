A randomised controlled trial of two pressure-reducing surfaces.
This randomised controlled trial of two dry-flotation pressure-reducing surfaces evaluates pressure sore incidence, patient comfort and the appropriate use of equipment in 100 orthopaedic patients. The trial involved five full Roho mattresses, five Sofflex mattresses and 10 Roho Quatro cushions to be used to complement the beds. Given the low rate of pressure sore incidence in this high-risk group it is not possible to determine whether there is any difference in effectiveness between the two mattresses. Both appear to provide similar levels of comfort, with the majority of patients finding them either comfortable or very comfortable. The initial setting of the equipment was, however, unsatisfactory.
