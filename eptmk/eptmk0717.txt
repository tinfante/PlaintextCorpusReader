A systematic review of different models of home and community care services for older persons
CRD SUMMARY: The review concluded that case management, integrated care and consumer-directed care differed according to the model's focus and that a combination of all three care models may maximise outcomes for older people. The authors' conclusions were appropriately cautious, but the reliability of the results is uncertain because of potential for bias in identifying studies and substantial study variability.
