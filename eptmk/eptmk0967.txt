Longterm efficacy of topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in knee osteoarthritis: metaanalysis of randomized placebo controlled clinical trials
CRD SUMMARY: The review assessed the long-term efficacy (at least 4 weeks) of topical therapies for pain control in primary knee osteoarthritis. The authors concluded that topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide effective pain relief for knee osteoarthritis. The authors caution against generalising to other NSAID preparations. The small data set on which the review was based, differences in treatment duration, uncertain study quality, and uncertainty about the statistical techniques used suggest that the authors' conclusion should be interpreted with caution.
