Supporting family caregivers in stroke care: a review of the evidence for problem solving
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effectiveness of teaching problem-solving skills to caregivers of stroke patients. The authors found weak evidence for a positive effect of problem-solving interventions versus usual care. Several limitations, including poorly reported inclusion criteria, the possibility of language and publication bias and the lack of consideration of the validity assessment, render the authors' conclusions unreliable.
