The role of prophylactic antibiotics in caesarean section--a randomised trial.
A prospective randomised controlled study was conducted over a 6 month period on the value of administering prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing emergency caesarean section at the Ipoh General Hospital. A total of 222 patients were randomised to receive 24 hours of ampicillin (500 mg per dose), cefoperazone (1 gm per dose) or no antibiotics. In all parameters of patient morbidity, the group receiving cefoperazone showed significantly better results as compared to the group not receiving antibiotics. The ampicillin group also had favourable results but generally not achieving statistical significance. Prophylactic antibiotics appear to be beneficial and consideration should be given to make it a routine in all emergency caesarean sections.
