The role of autologous blood transfusion in joint replacement surgery.
The efficacy of predeposited autologous blood transfusion (PABT) with and without intra/postoperative blood salvage to reduce or eliminate the need for homologous blood transfusion (HBT) in primary total hip or knee replacement surgery was investigated by retrospective and prospective studies. Depending on the type of surgery, one to three units of PABT eliminated the need for HBT in 50 to 78% of patients, but, intra/postoperative blood salvage alone reduced the need only in 11 to 29%. In contrast, blood salvage, when combined with three units of PABT, eliminated the need for HBT in all patients undergoing primary joint replacement surgery. A cost comparison analysis showed that blood salvage was more expensive than PABT, and therefore it should be limited to patients who had predeposited fewer than three units of autologous blood.
