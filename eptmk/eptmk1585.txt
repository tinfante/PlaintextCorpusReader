Oxytocin in prefilled Uniject injection devices for managing third-stage labor in Indonesia.
We assessed the use and acceptability of an injection device (Uniject) prefilled with oxytocin, as part of active management of third-stage labor (AMTL) by Indonesian midwives attending home births. We interviewed 140 village midwives (bidan di desa) and 2220 mothers whose deliveries they attended during the intervention period. We completed baseline and post-intervention assessments to determine their experiences and views of oxytocin Uniject use. Delivery logs and supervisory reports were reviewed. The assessment was done in three rural districts and one municipality in Lombok. Injection practices and oxytocin availability did not change dramatically, although dose accuracy, use of sterile injection equipment, and proper disposal improved when the Uniject device was used. Midwives had little difficulty using the Uniject device properly; they overwhelmingly preferred it to standard needles and syringes. Postpartum hemorrhage rates did not change substantially. Oxytocin via Uniject holds promise for safer, more convenient use of oxytocin by trained midwives attending home deliveries, thereby potentially reducing the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage.
