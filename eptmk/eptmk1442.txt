Transanal endoscopic microsurgery: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) with alternative surgical techniques for rectal tumours. The few studies found were of a poor quality and/or poorly reported. The authors' conclusion that evidence regarding TEM is limited appears reliable. Their conclusion that TEM may result in fewer recurrences than local excision of adenomas was derived from one poorly reported study and may not be reliable.
