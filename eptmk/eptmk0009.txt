Effect of fluoxetine on alcohol consumption in male alcoholics.
To test the effect of inhibiting serotonin uptake on voluntary alcohol intake, 20 alcohol-dependent males were housed on a locked hospital ward with 60-ml drinks of 97.5 proof alcohol available in a fixed interval drinking decision paradigm 13 times each day. After a 3-day, single-blind placebo baseline period, 10 subjects each received the serotonin uptake blocker fluoxetine (up to 80 mg po daily) or placebo double-blind for 28 days. The fluoxetine group had a 14% lower alcohol intake during the 1st week only, associated with a lower proportion of requests for alcohol and less craving for alcohol (as rated by research staff). There were no significant effects in later weeks, nor any differences in scores on the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales or the Hopkins Symptom Checklist.
