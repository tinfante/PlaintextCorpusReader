A decade in review: building on the experiences of past adolescent STI/HIV interventions to optimise future prevention efforts
CRD SUMMARY: This review, which assessed the effectiveness of sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention interventions for adolescents in different settings, concluded that certain components, such as condom use, appear to successfully reduce risk behaviours, but targeting of populations is needed to optimise future interventions. The authors appear to have considered the limitations of the included studies and their conclusions are likely to be reliable.
