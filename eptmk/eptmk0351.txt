Effectiveness of electronic guideline-based implementation systems in ambulatory care settings: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that there was little evidence for the effectiveness of electronic guideline-based implementation systems. The conclusions are in line with the evidence presented and appear reliable overall. However, the variety of interventions and settings included means that the generalisability of the findings to any particular setting may be limited.
