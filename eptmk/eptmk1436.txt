Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in invasive bladder cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This was a well-conducted meta-analysis of patient level data on the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on survival in invasive bladder cancer. The findings showed that neoadjuvant platinum combination chemotherapy confers a clear survival benefit in patients with invasive bladder cancer. There is no evidence to support the use of single-agent platinum neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
