Aspirin in the treatment of episiotomy pain.
We studied 160 postpartum women having moderate to severe episiotomy pain to determine the efficacy of aspirin analgesia, with 5, 10, and 20 grain doses, as compared to placebo. Over a four-hour period, all groups treated with aspirin showed significantly more improvement in pain intensity scores than those given placebo. Only a small percentage of patients required additional analgesic medication. This study shows that aspirin alone is an effective treatment for relief of moderate to severe episiotomy pain.
