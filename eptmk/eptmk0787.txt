A controlled trial of fluvoxamine in obsessive-compulsive disorder: implications for a serotonergic theory.
Thirty-eight patients with primary obsessive-compulsive disorder participated in a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the potent, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine. Fluvoxamine was significantly better than placebo on two of three measures of improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The authors also compared studies of the serotonergic agents fluvoxamine, sertraline, fluoxetine, and clomipramine and found that a greater effect size was associated with less serotonergic specificity and that some ability to affect other neurotransmitter systems may be a necessary but not sufficient requirement for antiobsessional activity. These data lend only partial support to a serotonin hypothesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
