The effects of position on oxygen saturation in acute stroke: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effect of body position on oxygen saturation in acute stroke. The authors found strong evidence that position does not affect oxygen saturation in non-hypoxic patients without relevant co-morbidities and limited evidence favouring an upright position for patients with relevant co-morbidities. The lack of supporting data from individual studies make the reliability of the conclusions uncertain.
