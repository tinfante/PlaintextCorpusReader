Early evidence on the effectiveness of clean indoor air legislation in New York State.
In July 2003, New York State implemented the Clean Indoor Air Act (CIAA) to reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). In this cross-sectional study, workers (n=168) completed an interview assessing ETS exposure and provided urine for cotinine analysis. Hospitality workers recruited after implementation of the CIAA had significant reductions in ETS exposure and urine cotinine, compared with those recruited before implementation. The New York State CIAA yielded measurable reductions in ETS exposure for hospitality workers.
