A systematic review of telephone-based interventions for mental disorders
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that telephone-based interventions may be effective for patients with mental disorders, but further rigorous research is required. The authors' conclusion reflects the limited evidence available, but the absence of a fully reported review process and quality assessment of the included studies mean that the overall reliability of the review is unclear.
