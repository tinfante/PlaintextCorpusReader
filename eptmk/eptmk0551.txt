Distribution of free untreated bednets bundled with insecticide via an integrated child health campaign in Lindi Region, Tanzania: lessons for future campaigns.
Use of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) to prevent malaria remains low, and effective distribution strategies are needed. An integrated child health campaign with free distribution of 162,254 untreated bednets bundled with insecticide, measles vaccination, vitamin A, and mebendazole for children < 5 years old ("under-5s") was conducted in Lindi Region, Tanzania. We conducted a representative household survey 3 months after the campaign. Altogether, 574 households with 354 under-5s were visited. In households with an under-5, possession of bednets and ITNs increased from 60.9% to 90.7% (P < 0.001) and from 16.5% to 37.3% (P < 0.001), respectively. Increases occurred in all wealth quintiles and equity improved. Reported bednet and ITN use the previous night among under-5s was 46.3% and 21.5%, respectively. Integrated campaigns rapidly and equitably increase bednet possession and use meriting continued large-scale implementation. However, our study found that bednets were rarely treated; thus, future campaigns should provide factory-treated long-lasting ITNs. Low ITN use underscores the need for further efforts to increase use after campaigns.
