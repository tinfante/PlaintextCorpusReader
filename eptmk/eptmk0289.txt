Pre-induction cervical ripening with prostaglandin E2 gel: intracervical versus intravaginal route.
The aim of our study was to evaluate the best method for cervical ripening before a classical induction with amniotomy and oxytocin. One hundred term pregnant patients who presented an unfavorable cervix and an indication for the induction of labor were assigned randomly to either 0.5 mg prostaglandin (PG) E2 gel intracervically (N = 52) or 3 mg PGE2 gel intravaginally (N = 48). The intravaginal gel had a greater effect on cervical ripening according to a modification of the Bishop score than did intracervical gel, but it had a higher incidence of side effects.
