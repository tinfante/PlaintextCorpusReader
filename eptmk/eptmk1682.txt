Statins in hypercholesterolaemia: a dose-specific meta-analysis of lipid changes in randomised, double blind trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the efficacy of statins in reducing blood cholesterol. The authors concluded that statins reduced total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hence were effective for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. The potential for selection bias and the pooling of seemingly clinically diverse data make the reliability of the results uncertain.
