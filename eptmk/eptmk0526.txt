Background and design of a controlled clinical trial (ARC 090) for the treatment of opioid dependence.
This study represents the largest clinical trial reported to date that demonstrated the efficacy of buprenorphine for opioid dependence treatment (Johnson et al. 1992). Although the study design was adequate to demonstrate differences between treatment groups, there has not been a consensus regarding the most appropriate method for analyzing various outcome measures of this and similar studies. To present a comprehensive review of these methods, other chapters in this monograph focus on various analytical techniques for assessing one of these measures--urine toxicology screens--for illicit opioids.
