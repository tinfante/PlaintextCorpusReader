Support for family carers who care for an elderly person at home: a systematic literature review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed interventions providing support for family carers of elderly co-habiting persons at home. The authors appear to conclude that it is uncertain if carers benefit from the interventions. Limitations of the review included poor reporting of the review methods and an inadequate validity assessment. However, given the apparent, general poor quality of the included studies, the authors' conclusions appear reliable.
