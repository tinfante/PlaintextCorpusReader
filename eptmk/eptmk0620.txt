A controlled study of lithium carbonate in the treatment of alcoholism.
A prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted during a 6-month period showed that lithium carbonate was no better than placebo in producing total abstinence in patients with alcoholism, regardless of whether they were depressed. A high dropout rate, the effect of compliance, and difficulties in measuring improvement in these patients impose some limitations in interpreting the results of this study.
