A 3-year oral health dose-response study of sodium monofluorophosphate dentifrices with and without zinc citrate: anti-caries results.
A 3-yr clinical trial has been conducted on 3000 12-yr-old children in Lanarkshire, Scotland, with the aim of investigating the effects on oral health of toothpastes containing both sodium monofluorophosphate and zinc citrate, the former being present at fluoride levels of 1000, 1500, and 2500 ppm F. No significant difference in caries increments was found between the group of children using toothpastes incorporating zinc citrate and their counterparts using zinc-free pastes. However, a significant anti-caries dose-response was demonstrated over the SMFP range used. This dose-response was evident for boys and girls and also for the various types of teeth and tooth surfaces.
