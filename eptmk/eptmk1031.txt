Laser vaporization versus laser excision conization in the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
One hundred patients with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia suitable for ablative therapy were randomly allocated to treatment by either laser vaporization or laser excision conization under local anesthesia in the outpatient colposcopy clinic. The two methods were compared with respect to the immediate surgical complications, ease of performance, and long-term complications. They were comparable in most respects, and both were well accepted by the patients. Laser excision had the added advantage of providing further material for histologic examination to confirm the absence of invasion and the completeness of excision of the lesion.
