Population tobacco control interventions and their effects on social inequalities in smoking
CRD SUMMARY: This well-conducted review assessed the effects of population level tobacco control interventions on smoking related health inequalities. The authors concluded that these interventions have the potential to reduce health inequalities for disadvantaged groups. A need for further rigorous research in a number of specific areas was identified. Given the level of evidence presented, the authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable.
