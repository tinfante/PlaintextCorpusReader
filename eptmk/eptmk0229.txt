Reducing the amount of blood transfused: a systematic review of behavioral interventions to change physicians' transfusion practices
CRD SUMMARY: The review evaluated the effectiveness of behavioural interventions to change transfusion practices of physicians. The authors concluded that such interventions appeared appropriate in changing practice and reducing blood utilisation, although further studies are needed to determine the relative effectiveness of different types of interventions. The suitably cautious conclusion is appropriate and reflects limitations in the review process and included studies.
