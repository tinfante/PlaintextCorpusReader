Complications of subcutaneous low-dose heparin therapy in neurosurgical patients.
BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism is a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality in neurosurgery. The use of low-dose unfractionated heparin therapy perioperatively for prophylaxis against deep vein thromboses and pulmonary embolism has been well demonstrated in many other surgical specialties but is less commonly used in neurosurgery because of fears of devastating postoperative hematomas. METHODS: The safety of such therapy has been analyzed in 950 patients undergoing an inpatient neurosurgical procedure. 872 patients (152 cranial procedures) completed treatment with 5000 U sodium heparin subcutaneously twice a day, commencing before surgery and continuing till patients were ambulatory. RESULTS: There were three minor hemorrhagic complications-two superficial wound hematomas (one requiring treatment) and one gastrointestinal hemorrhage-identified. Three clinically significant major complications developed, two epidural hematomas after spinal surgery requiring evacuation and one intraventricular hemorrhage after brain biopsy. CONCLUSION: This report, along with an analysis of previously published reports of low-dose perioperative heparin therapy in neurosurgical patients, suggests that such therapy is unlikely to be associated with increased morbidity. Given the known efficacy of low-dose heparin in reducing venous thromboembolism in other surgical patients, such therapy may reduce mortality and morbidity from thromboembolic complications in neurosurgical patients with minimal risk.
