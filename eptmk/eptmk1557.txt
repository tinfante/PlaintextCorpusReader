Routine blood tests as predictors of mortality in hip fracture patients.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the evidence for the association between different biochemical markers at admission and mortality through a meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed-, Embase-, Cochran Library and the Web of Knowledge were searched for cohort studies.
STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were observational studies with a study population larger than 150 subjects, a mean age above 60 years and a study duration below 730 days.
DATA EXTRACTION: Characteristics of studies and outcomes of all-cause mortality were extracted from the retrieved articles. Data were pooled across studies for the individual biomarker using random- or fixed-effect analysis.
DATA SYNTHESIS: 15 eligible studies of 5 different markers on mortality were studied. The following markers were found to be of prognostic value on mortality in hip fracture patients: low haemoglobin (odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 2.17-3.55; P<0.00001, 3148 subjects included), low total lymphocyte count, TLC (odds ratio, 2.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-4.20; P<0.00001, 1689 subjects included), low albumin (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-2.56; P=0.0004, 1680 subjects included), low albumin/low TLC (odds ratio, 3.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.81-4.99; P<0.0001, 704 subjects included), low albumin/high TLC (odds ratio, 3.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.83-6.29; P=0.0001, 704 subjects included), high creatinine (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.99; P=0.0001, 3761 subjects included), and high PTH (odds ratio, 15.43; 95% confidence interval, 3.60-66.14; P=0.0002, 525 subjects included).
CONCLUSION: Biochemical markers at admission are valid predictors of mortality in hip fracture patients.
