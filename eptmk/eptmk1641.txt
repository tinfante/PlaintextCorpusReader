Quality of life and coping styles of HIV-positive women with children.
This descriptive study explored the quality of life and coping methods of HIV positive women (N = 52) with children. The sample consisted of women with HIV/AIDS who answered an adapted Padilla Quality of Life Index and the Jalowiec Coping Scale. Among the psychological, physical, and social quality of life subscales, social quality of life was rated highest and the psychological scale rated the lowest. Among the three styles of coping, confrontive was used most frequently, passive and emotive less frequently. Significant relationships between coping and quality of life were examined. It is essential that nurses working with women with HIV disease be aware of their common concerns and provide effective strategies to improve quality of life such as enhancing decision making and coping skills within the context of the family unit.
