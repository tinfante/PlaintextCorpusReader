Efficacy and safety of anticoagulant treatment in acute cardioembolic stroke: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that the use of early anticoagulation in patients with acute ischaemic cardioembolic stroke to prevent early recurrence or to improve functional outcome is not supported by the evidence. This was a well-conducted review and the authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable.
