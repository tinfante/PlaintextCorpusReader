Modifying dietary and tobacco use patterns in the worksite: the Take Heart Project.
This article describes the conceptual basis, design, and intervention approach for a worksite-based heart disease risk reduction project. Baseline characteristics of the 26 moderate size worksites participating in the Take Heart Project are also described. The trial is designed to produce changes at both the organization and employee level on tobacco use, dietary fat intake, and serum cholesterol. A key feature of the intervention is creation of employee steering committees to enhance ownership and involvement. From a menu of brief, low-intensity health education and environmental change activities, these committees select activities best suited to their worksite. The baseline characteristics of organizations randomized to intervention and control conditions were similar, and indicated a relatively high level of worksite activity related to cholesterol and smoking.
