Prognosis after aortic root replacement with cryopreserved allografts in adults
CRD SUMMARY: This review used meta-analysis and modelling to predict age-specific long-term prognosis after allograft aortic replacement (ARR) in adults. The authors concluded that ARR has an age-related limited durability, which leads to an increased risk of lifetime structural valve failure that requires reoperation in younger patients. Limitations in the reporting of the review process and data used to populate the model mean that the results may not be reliable.
