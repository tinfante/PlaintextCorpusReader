Effect of fish oil on heart rate in humans: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review looked at the effect on heart rate of supplementary fish oils. The authors concluded that fish oils lower the heart rate, particularly in people with higher baseline heart rate and in those taking fish oils for a longer duration. The review was generally well conducted, but differences in the results between studies weaken conclusions over all populations and interventions.
