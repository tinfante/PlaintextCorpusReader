Low dose heparin and compression stockings in the prevention of postoperative deep venous thrombosis.
The frequency of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was studied in 98 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. All the patients received low dose heparin prophylaxis 5000 i.u. every 12 h for 5-7 days. In each patient, a graduated compression stocking was also worn and randomly allocated to one of the legs and the other leg served as a control. DVT was diagnosed by the 125I-fibrinogen method. Four patients developed bilateral DVT and 8 patients unilateral DVT, all of whom developed it in the control leg. The difference in unilateral DVT between stockinged and control legs was significant (P < 0.004). It is concluded that a combination of low dose heparin and graduated compression stockings is more effective than low dose heparin alone in reducing the frequency of postoperative DVT. It is suggested that this combination of prophylaxis might be of value in high risk patients.
