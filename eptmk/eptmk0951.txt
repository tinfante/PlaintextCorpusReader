Antibiotic and prednisolone therapy of erysipelas: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study.
112 patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of erysipelas, were randomized to 8 days treatment with prednisolone or placebo in addition to antibiotics. 108 patients received the study drugs and were evaluated for time to cure, which was the primary end-point. The median healing time was significantly shorter in the prednisolone group, 5 days, vs 6 days in the placebo group (p < 0.01). The 90th percentile healing time was 10.0 days in the prednisolone group vs 14.6 days in the control group. The prednisolone-treated patients had a median length of hospital stay (secondary end-point) of 5 days vs 6 for the placebo-treated (p < 0.01). The median treatment time with intravenous antibiotics (secondary end-point) was 4 days in the placebo group, which was 1 day longer than in the prednisolone group (p < 0.05). 13 patients, 7 of whom received placebo, relapsed during the observation period of 3 weeks. The frequency of side effects attributable to the study drug was not higher in the prednisolone group.
