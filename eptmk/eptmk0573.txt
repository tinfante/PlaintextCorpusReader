Comparison of enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, and unfractionated heparin, with or without dihydroergotamine, in abdominal hysterectomy.
The effects of administration of low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin 20 mg) once a day, of unfractionated heparin (5000 IU twice a day, and of unfractionated heparin (2500 IU) plus dihydroergotamine (0.5 mg) twice a day were assessed in 100 patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. The test medications were given subcutaneously 2 hours before operation and for 3 days thereafter. There were no thromboembolic complications. Intraoperative blood loss, wound haematomas and blood loss via drains during four days after operation were similar in the three groups. None of the 37 patients receiving enoxaparin experienced major postoperative bleeding. Six out of 31 patients receiving unfractionated heparin without dihydroergotamine and two out of 32 patients receiving dihydroergotamine in addition experienced major bleeding necessitating re-operation and/or blood transfusion, (P < 0.05). Enoxaparin caused less major bleeding than unfractionated heparin with or without dihydroergotamine in patients undergoing hysterectomy.
