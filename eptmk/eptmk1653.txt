Effects of physiotherapy in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome: a systematic review of the literature
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that for shoulder impingement syndrome, physiotherapist-led exercises and surgery appeared to be equally effective in the long-term. Home-based exercises appeared to be as effective as combined physiotherapy interventions. Passive treatments did not appear to be effective. Trials differed widely and there was insufficient high-quality evidence to reach definite conclusions. This judgement appears to be reliable.
