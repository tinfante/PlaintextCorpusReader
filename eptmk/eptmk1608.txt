Contingent social reinforcement for fluid compliance in a hemodialysis patient.
Two approaches, (a) patient education and (b) compliance-contingent social reinforcement, were employed to improve compliance with fluid restrictions in a chronically noncompliant hemodialysis patient of borderline intellectual functioning. Results indicated that only social reinforcement led to improved compliance (i.e., decreased intersession weight gain). Treatment effects were well maintained at both 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Contingency management strategies are recommended as a potentially cost effective treatment for noncompliance in hemodialysis patients.
