Low-dose warfarin in atrial fibrillation leads to more thromboembolic events without reducing major bleeding when compared to adjusted-dose: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review looked at the effects of low- or mini-dose warfarin, compared with a regimen where the warfarin dose was adjusted to a target International Normalised Ratio (INR), in people with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. The risk of thromboembolic events was higher with low- or mini-dose warfarin. The review appears to have been well conducted and the conclusions are supported by the data presented.
