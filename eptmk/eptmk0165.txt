Prevention of thromboembolic disease by external pneumatic compression in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.
A prospective study was undertaken in order to test the efficacy of intermittent calf compression for prevention of thromboembolism in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The patients were studied pre- and postoperatively by routine Doppler ultrasound examinations in addition to clinical assessment. Statistically significant evidence substantiates the view that intermittent calf compression decreased the incidence of thr thromboembolic problem.
