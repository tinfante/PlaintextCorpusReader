Are mobile phones and handheld computers being used to enhance delivery of psychiatric treatment? A systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that use of mobile phones may be effective in augmenting interventions for smoking cessation but there was little evidence of effectiveness for patients with anxiety disorders. The limited search, potential for language and publication biases and the lack of information provided in the results mean that the reliability of the authors' conclusions are unclear.
