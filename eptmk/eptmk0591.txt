Medical compared with surgical treatment for massive pulmonary embolism.
We compared embolectomy (when available) with thrombolysis in patients with shock and massive pulmonary embolism. 13 patients were operated on, 10 (77%) of whom survived. The inferior vena cava was routinely clipped. The 24 medically treated patients were given alteplase until systemic and pulmonary artery pressures stabilised and heparin thereafter; 16 (67%) survived. Major haemorrhage occurred in 28% of medically treated patients, but was not fatal. 1 patient had a small cerebral haemorrhage that resolved without drainage. One-fifth of the medical group had a re-embolism, which suggests that temporary caval umbrellas are indicated in medically treated patients. Thrombolysis may provide a life-saving option and a randomised trial is warranted.
