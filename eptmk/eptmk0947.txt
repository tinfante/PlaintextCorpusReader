Shoulder function following early mobilization of the shoulder after mastectomy and axillary dissection.
A prospective clinical trial was conducted to determine the effect of axillary node dissection for breast carcinoma on shoulder function and seroma production. 59 Operations were carried out in 57 patients. The patients were divided into two groups. In group A, shoulder exercises were started, under the guidance of a physiotherapist, immediately following surgery, and in group B the exercises were begun on the seventh postoperative day. A full range of motion within six months was achieved in 25 patients of group A (81%) and in 22 of group B (79%). There was no significant difference in wound drainage between the two groups. Restricted shoulder movement was often seen after local wound complications following axillary radiotherapy or after seriously disturbed wound healing.
