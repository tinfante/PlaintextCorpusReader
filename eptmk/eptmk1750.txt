Foot pump prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis: the rate of effective usage in trauma patients.
Trauma patients are at risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) but often cannot receive systemic anticoagulation therapy. The major reason for failure of mechanical methods of DVT prophylaxis is ineffective usage. It has been postulated that foot pumps may have a better compliance rate than do other devices. One thousand observations were performed on trauma patients in both the intensive care unit (ICU) and on the surgical ward. Foot pumps were applied properly and functioning correctly 59% of the time. Patients in the ICU had significantly better compliance than did patients on the surgical ward. These rates are not better than published rates for other devices for DVT prophylaxis.
