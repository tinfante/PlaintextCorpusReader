Long term efficacy of DOTS regimens for tuberculosis: systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the efficacy of standard directly observed treatment, short-course 6-month regimens of treatment in preventing the recurrence of tuberculosis. The authors concluded that few studies have assessed recurrence rates of such regimens under routine conditions. Poor reporting of review methodology means that this conclusion is probably, though not certainly, reliable.
