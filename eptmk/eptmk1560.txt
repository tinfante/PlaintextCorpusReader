Benzydamine hydrochloride oral rinses in management of burning mouth syndrome. A clinical trial.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the topical use of benzydamine hydrochloride 0.15% oral mouthwashes in the control of burning mouth syndrome symptoms.
STUDY DESIGN: In this double-blind, randomized, longitudinal investigation, each of 30 patients with burning mouth syndrome was assigned to one of 3 management modalities. Those in group A received an oral rinse solution of benzydamine hydrochloride 0.15% 3 times a day for 4 weeks, those in group B received a placebo 3 times a day for 4 weeks, and those in group C did not receive any kind of treatment. A visual analog scale was used for evaluation of the symptoms; a Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance exact test was performed on the resulting data.
RESULTS: The findings of this investigation failed to reveal significant differences among the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical application of benzydamine hydrochloride oral rinses in the treatment of patients with burning mouth syndrome did not demonstrate significative efficacy in comparison with use of a placebo solution.
