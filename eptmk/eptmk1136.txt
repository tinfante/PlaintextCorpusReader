Psychosocial intervention in stroke: Families in Recovery from Stroke Trial (FIRST).
A family-focused psychosocial intervention for stroke survivors is described and illustrated with case studies. It is designed to improve functional recovery through four specific pathways: increased knowledge, efficacy, and control through stroke education; optimized social support; increased network cohesion; and improved problem-solving abilities. Rationales for these pathways are presented and methods of implementing them discussed.
