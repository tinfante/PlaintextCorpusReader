Chronic fissure-in-ano: a randomized study comparing open and subcutaneous lateral internal sphincterotomy.
A prospective study comparing open and subcutaneous lateral internal sphincterotomy for chronic anal fissure was conducted. One hundred twelve patients were randomized to open (n = 54) or subcutaneous (n = 58) sphincterotomy. There was no significant difference in acute complications between the subcutaneous (8.6 percent) and open (7.4 percent) groups. Postoperative length of stay was significantly shorter for the subcutaneous group (1.7 +/- 0.2 days) than for the open group (2.3 +/- 0.1 days; P less than 0.001). Although the response rate to a pain questionnaire was less than 50 percent, the data suggest a lower level of postoperative pain in the subcutaneous group. Fissure healing was similar between the subcutaneous (96.6 percent) and open (94.4 percent) groups. We conclude that subcutaneous lateral internal sphincterotomy for chronic fissure-in-ano is effective and may result in significantly less postoperative discomfort, shorter postoperative lengths of stay, and a comparable rate of complications compared with the open technique.
