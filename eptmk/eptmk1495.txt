A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature: chemotherapy and surgery versus surgery alone in non-small cell lung cancer
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that pre-operative chemotherapy plus surgery results in a significant survival benefit over surgery alone in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. The results of the review reflect the evidence reviewed, but the limitations of the included studies, and the exclusion of 5 eligible trials because of inadequate reporting of the outcome data, reduce the reliability of the conclusions.
