Pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy.
Pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignancies has changed from a random "picking" of some pelvic and aortic lymph nodes to a well-established technique based on adequate knowledge of the patterns of spread of the primary tumor. The identification of the node groups to remove, the number of nodes to count, and the border of dissection in the different clinical situations make pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy a reproducible surgical intervention. The large experience accumulated over the years has greatly improved the technique and perioperative and complication management. The improved knowledge of the natural history of gynecologic tumors has refined the indications for lymph node dissection. Today, pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy is primarily a staging procedure. The therapeutic value of lymphadenectomy is recognized in the surgical treatment of cervical cancer, but it is still under evaluation in ovarian and endometrial tumors.
