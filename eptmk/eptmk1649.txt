Short- versus long-course antibacterial therapy for community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that there was no difference in the effectiveness and safety of short- versus long-course antimicrobial treatment for adult and paediatric patients with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia. The authors' conclusions reflect the evidence presented, but should not be considered definitive given the small number of trials in the analysis.
