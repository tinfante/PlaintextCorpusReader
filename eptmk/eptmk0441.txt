Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery and acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis of randomized and observational studies
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that although more research using consistent definitions was needed, evidence suggested that off-pump coronary artery bypass reduced the risk of acute kidney injury. Randomised trials were underpowered to detect any effect on need for renal replacement therapy; evidence from observational studies suggested a beneficial effect. Most data came from observational studies. The authors' conclusions appear suitably cautious.
