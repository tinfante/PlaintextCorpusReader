Subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin fragmin versus intravenous unfractionated heparin in the treatment of acute non massive pulmonary embolism: an open randomized pilot study.
Low-molecular-weight heparins have been extensively investigated in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis but limited data are available concerning their use in pulmonary embolism. In an open, pilot, randomized study, we compare the safety and efficacy of Fragmin, a low-molecular-weight heparin with those of unfractionated heparin in 60 patients with non massive pulmonary embolism (Miller Index < 20). Thirty one patients received unfractionated heparin intravenously and 29 received a fixed dose of 120 Anti-Xa IU/kg of Fragmin administered subcutaneously twice a day for 10 days. There was no pulmonary embolism recurrence nor major bleeding in either group during the treatment period. The decrease in pulmonary vascular obstruction on perfusion lung scan between day 0 and day 10 was 17 +/- 13% in the Fragmin group and 16 +/- 13% in the heparin group (NS). These results indicate that Fragmin may be a safe and effective treatment of submassive pulmonary embolism.
