Psychological treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effectiveness of psychological interventions for the treatment of adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and found that exposure with response prevention and cognitive restructuring were effective in reducing symptoms. The authors' conclusions appear to reflect the evidence, but consideration should be given to the low level of study quality and the potential for bias in the review.
