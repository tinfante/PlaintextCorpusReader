Off-label use of drug-eluting versus bare metal stents: a lesion-specific systematic review of long-term outcomes
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that rates of mortality, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis were similar in patients with bare metal stents and those with drug-eluting stents. Rates of target lesion revascularisation were lower in patients with drug-eluting stents. These conclusions should be interpreted with caution given the low methodological rigour of most of the included studies and concerns about review methods.
