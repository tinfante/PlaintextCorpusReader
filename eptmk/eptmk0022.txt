CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effects of sibutramine on weight and glycaemic control in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The authors concluded that sibutramine may help to improve glycaemic control because it reduces weight. Inadequate reporting of the quality assessment, characteristics of the included studies, drop-outs and some review methods makes interpretation of the evidence difficult.
