[Results of cyclosporin treatment of severe, chronic psoriasis vulgaris]
Controlled double-blind studies have demonstrated the efficacy of 14 mg/kg per day cyclosporin A (CsA) in patients with severe psoriasis. Recently a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized study confirmed that CsA therapy (mean dose 5.5 mg/kg/day improves psoriasis significantly. We have carried out a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial involving 12 patients suffering from severe psoriasis resistant to local therapy. Within 4 weeks, 5 mg/kg per day CsA resulted in 6 patients in a mean reduction of 72.5% of the PASI score, which differed significantly from the mean reduction of 18.1% in 6 patients receiving placebo. The most important side-effect was reversible hypertension in 1 patient. The preliminary results of a dose-finding study that started recently indicate that 1-3 mg/kg per day CsA results in a significant improvement in the patient's condition.
