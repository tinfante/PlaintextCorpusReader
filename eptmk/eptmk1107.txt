A research synthesis of social story interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders
CRD SUMMARY: This review attempted to assess the effectiveness of social stories for educating children with autism spectrum disorders. The authors concluded that current evidence supports the use of social story interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders. Poorly defined inclusion criteria, a limited search strategy and a small evidence base limit the reliability of these findings.
