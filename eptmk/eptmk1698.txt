Ceftazidime as a single agent in the management of children with fever and neutropenia.
Fifty consecutive episodes of fever in neutropenic children with malignant disease or aplastic anaemia were randomized to treatment with either ceftazidime alone or a combination of azlocillin and tobramycin, pending the results of bacteriological investigation. More than 90% of organisms isolated from these episodes were sensitive to ceftazidime, which appears to be a non-toxic alternative to aminoglycosides in such circumstances.
