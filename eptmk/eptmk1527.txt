Mortality and target haemoglobin concentrations in anaemic patients with chronic kidney disease treated with erythropoietin: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This well-conducted review examined the effect of targeting low and high levels of haemoglobin when treating patients with anaemia resulting from chronic kidney disease with erythropoietin. The authors concluded that targeting a high haemoglobin level increases patient overall mortality. These conclusions are likely to be reliable.
