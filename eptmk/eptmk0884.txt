Adenoidectomy for middle ear disorders: a randomized controlled trial.
Repeated tympanometric screening of a regionally defined population of 3-year-old children defined a group of 42 children with middle ear disease which had persisted for at least 6 months. These children were treated by either myringotomy with adenoidectomy or myringotomy without adenoidectomy decided by random allocation. Postoperative observation during 6 months failed to disclose any difference in middle ear status between the two groups.
