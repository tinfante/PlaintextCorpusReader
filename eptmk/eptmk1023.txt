Using amino-cerv after cervical LEEP.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of Amino-Cerv to promote healing of the cervix following loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP) of the cervix for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized study was conducted on 48 women in a private office setting. Patients were divided into two groups, to use or not use Amino-Cerv intravaginally for two weeks after the procedure. Statistical analysis of the findings were performed using the chi 2 test. RESULTS: Twenty of 24 (83%) of women using Amino-Cerv had completely healed tissue at four weeks, whereas 12 of 24 (50%) in the untreated group had healed tissue at four weeks. Findings were not statistically significant at two weeks but were statistically significant (P < .005, power = .55) at four weeks after the procedure. CONCLUSION: Amino-Cerv after LEEP of the cervix promotes healing.
