Development of use and cost measures in a nursing intervention for family caregivers and frail elderly patients.
The purpose of this pilot study was to refine and evaluate methods of measuring costs of an innovative home-health nursing intervention designed to support frail, older persons and their family caregivers. We evaluated a multifaceted strategy to collect a detailed utilization profile from 22 caregiver/care receiver dyads for hospital, ambulatory, home health, nursing home, and community services. The strategy was feasible for most participants, maximized accuracy of cost data, and minimized research burden on study participants. Lower overall costs were found in the intervention group, but the difference was not significant. Approaches to the measurement of costs in this study can serve as models for evaluating other innovations in nursing, home care, and long-term care.
