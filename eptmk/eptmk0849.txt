Meta-analysis of the relationship between non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and coronary heart disease risk
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that most lipid-modifying monotherapies showed an approximate one-to-one relationship between the lowering of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and coronary heart disease. There were multiple shortcomings, but a very large number of patients in randomised trials were included. The authors' conclusions may be reliable, but confirmation with individual patient data is required.
