Testing an intervention to prevent further abuse to pregnant women.
Although violence against women is recognized as a major public health problem, few interventions have been developed to reduce abuse. In this study, 132 pregnant women received three counseling sessions that were designed to reduce further abuse. A comparison group of 67 abused women were offered wallet-sized cards listing community resources for abuse. Women in both groups were followed at 6 months and 12 months post-delivery. Using repeated measures MANCOVA with entry scores as a covariate, we found significantly less violence reported by women in the intervention group than by women in the comparison group.
