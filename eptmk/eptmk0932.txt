[Treatment of soft tissue trauma with BPAA gel. Results of an Italian multicenter study vs. placebo]
A double-blind study vs placebo was carried out on 82 pts suffering from soft tissue trauma, to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of a new anti-inflammatory, non-steroidal analgesic for topical use, 3% BPAA. Clinical results obtained by the group treated with BPAA gel were highly significant (p = 0.01) and positive, showing absence of local and systemic side-effects. Accordingly, BPAA gel can be recommended for treatment of soft tissue trauma.
