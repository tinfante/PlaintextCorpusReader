Manual versus electric vacuum aspiration for first-trimester abortion: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This well-conducted review found that there is some evidence that manual vacuum aspiration is as effective and acceptable as electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) and that it may be safer than EVA. These conclusions are likely to be reliable, although the authors appropriately recommended some degree of caution in interpreting the results given the small sample sizes and methodological limitations of some of the included studies.
