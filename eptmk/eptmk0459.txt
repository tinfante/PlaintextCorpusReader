D-dimer testing for deep venous thrombosis: a metaanalysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the accuracy of D-dimer assays for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. The authors concluded that there was no support for the use of stand-alone D-dimer assays. The limited search might have resulted in the omission of some relevant studies, and the results varied considerably among the studies identified. However, the authors' conclusions are likely to be robust.
