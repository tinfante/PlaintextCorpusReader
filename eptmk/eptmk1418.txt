Neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in children: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This generally well-conducted review found that antiviral drugs (oseltamivir and zanamivir) shortened the duration of illness in children with seasonal influenza and reduced transmission to other children in the household, although these effects were small. The conclusions appear to be reliable for seasonal influenza, but their applicability to H1N1 pandemic influenza is uncertain.
