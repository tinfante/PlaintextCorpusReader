Long-term intracervical contraception with a levonorgestrel device.
An intracervical levonorgestrel-releasing mini-T device was tried as contraceptive in 100 fertile multiparous women for 3 years. This device release about 10 micrograms/day. The results were compared with those of an intrauterine levonorgestrel device and copper-T-200 (Cu-T-200). The continuation rates of the three device did not reveal any significant differences at 1, 2 and 3 years. Incidence of unintended pregnancies and removals due to bleeding and pain was comparable to those of Cu-T-200 but higher than those of intrauterine levonorgestrel device. The number of days of bleeding and spotting for both levonorgestrel devices was significantly lower than those for Cu-T-200.
