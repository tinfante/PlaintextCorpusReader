Outcomes of children and adolescents with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma and pulmonary metastases following 131I treatment: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that most paediatric and adolescent patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma and pulmonary metastases did not achieve a complete response to iodine-131 therapy, but disease-specific morbidity and mortality remained low; careful dosing was required to minimise the adverse effects. Quality deficits in the review and the included studies make it uncertain whether the conclusions are supported.
