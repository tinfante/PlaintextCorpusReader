Effect of intensive glucose lowering treatment on all cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and microvascular events in type 2 diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that the benefits of intensive glucose lowering treatment were limited: a 19% increase in all-cause death and a 43% increase in cardiovascular death could not be ruled out. The benefit to risk ratio in the prevention of vascular events remained uncertain. Given the limitations of the included studies and the analysis undertaken, the authors' cautious conclusions seem appropriate.
