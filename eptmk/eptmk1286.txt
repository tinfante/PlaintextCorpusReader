Non-invasive imaging compared with intra-arterial angiography in the diagnosis of symptomatic carotid stenosis: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review determined the accuracy of noninvasive imaging for diagnosing carotid stenosis in patients with carotid territory ischaemic symptoms. The authors' cautious conclusions, that existing data might support the cautious use of noninvasive imaging to diagnose 70 to 99% stenosis by experts in carotid imaging, but more data are needed to determine the accuracy of the commonly used noninvasive imaging tests in routine practice, appear appropriate.
