Development and evaluation of an HIV-risk reduction program for female college students.
College students are engaging in high rates of behavior related to risk of infection from Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). A cognitive-behavioral skills training program for heterosexual college females focused on sexual assertiveness skills and the reduction of risk-related behaviors was designed and evaluated compared with an education-only program. Participants completed pre-intervention, post-intervention, and one-month follow-up assessments of: (a) HIV/STD-related knowledge and beliefs; (b) sexual, alcohol, and drug-related behaviors; and (c) sexual assertiveness role-plays. Skills training participants compared to education-only participants scored higher on sexual assertiveness skills, specific knowledge of HIV infection, and self-efficacy to perform lower risk sexual behaviors and reported a reduction in risk-related behaviors at post-intervention and follow-up assessments. The effectiveness of behavioral skills in HIV risk-reduction programs for college students is discussed.
