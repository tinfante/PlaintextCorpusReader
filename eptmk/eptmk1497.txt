Systematic review: FDA-approved prescription medications for adults with constipation
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that there is a lack of high-quality evidence supporting the use of lactulose and polyethylene glycol-3350 in the treatment of chronic constipation, although the data does support use in acute, episodic constipation. High-quality evidence supporting the use of tegaserod was found. Potential publication and language bias, limitations of the evidence, and differences between the studies mean that the authors' conclusions should be interpreted with caution.
