The efficacy of subacromial corticosteroid injection in the treatment of rotator cuff disease: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The authors of this review found that there was little reproducible evidence to support the efficacy of subacromial corticosteroid injections in the management of rotator cuff disease. These conclusions appear appropriate given the evidence presented, though there remains the possibility that some relevant evidence might not have been identified.
