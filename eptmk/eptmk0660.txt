Terazosin: a new alpha 1-blocker for the treatment of hypertension: a review of randomized, controlled clinical trials of once-daily administration as monotherapy.
Terazosin, a new selective long-acting alpha1-adrenergic blocking agent, has been shown to be an effective once-daily antihypertensive agent in four of five randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies of patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In one trial, 24-h monitoring revealed that terazosin produced a sustained blood pressure lowering effect throughout the day. In three fixed-dose trials, steady patterns of blood pressure response during maintenance therapy indicated that tolerance to terazosin did not develop. Favourable changes in the plasma lipid profile were observed, while laboratory data suggested the development of haemodilution. Overall, terazosin was well tolerated. Asthenia, dizziness and peripheral oedema were significantly more common in patients treated with terazosin than with placebo.
