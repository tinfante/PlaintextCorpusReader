EMG biofeedback used to reduce standing levels of paraspinal muscle tension in chronic low back pain.
Twenty chronic low back pain (LBP) patients with relatively high standing paraspinal EMG levels (greater than 5 microV) were randomly assigned to 2 groups. One group (N = 10) received EMG biofeedback training to reduce standing paraspinal EMG levels, the other group (N = 10) served as a waiting list control group. Changes in perceived pain (duration X intensity) and paraspinal EMG in standing position were measured at a 3 week pretreatment baseline, during the 3 week treatment period, and at a 3 week post-treatment baseline. Compared to patients in the waiting list control group, those who received EMG biofeedback showed a significant decrease in standing paraspinal EMG from pretreatment to post-treatment baseline. However, no significant differences in reported pain were found during these periods. It is concluded that reduction of standing paraspinal EMG does not lead to reduction in pain.
