Stent-graft repair of aortobronchial fistula: a review
CRD SUMMARY: Emergency stent-graft repair appeared to be a reasonable solution for patients with acute aortic rupture into airways. However, due to the risks of longer term recurrence and mortality, it should be considered as a bridge to subsequent elective repair. The authors acknowledged the possibility of publication bias and the lower quality of included studies, consequently their conclusions seem reasonable.
