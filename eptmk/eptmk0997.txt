Bupropion hydrochloride versus placebo, in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy, for the treatment of cocaine abuse/dependence.
Bupropion hydrochloride is a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor which may be an effective treatment for cocaine dependence due to its ability to reverse deficits in dopaminergic functioning that occur in chronic cocaine users. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial comparing outpatient treatment with bupropion (N = 37) and placebo (N = 33) in combination with standard cognitive behavioral therapy. There were no statistically significant differences between bupropion and placebo in treatment outcomes, including aggregate measures of urine drug screen results (Joint Probability Index at 16 weeks: 0.43 for bupropion and 0.38 for placebo), treatment retention, cocaine craving ratings, and assessments of depressive symptoms. The failure to find an effect for bupropion relative to placebo, when combined with standard cognitive behavioral therapy, dampens enthusiasm for future development of bupropion as a cocaine pharmacotherapy.
