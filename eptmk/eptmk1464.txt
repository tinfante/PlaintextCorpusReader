Tolerability and effectiveness of (S)-amlodipine compared with racemic amlodipine in hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that according to limited evidence there were no significant differences between (S)-amlodipine 2.5mg and racemic amlodipine 5mg in blood pressure. (S)-amlodipine resulted in significantly less oedema, although not in higher quality studies. The review was well-conducted, but the results should be treated with caution due to the scarcity of high-quality studies.
