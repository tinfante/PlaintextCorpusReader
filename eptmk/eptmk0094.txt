Rhythm vs. rate control of atrial fibrillation meta-analysed by number needed to treat
CRD SUMMARY: This review looked at rate control versus rhythm control for atrial fibrillation. The authors found that rate control was associated with a lower incidence of hospitalisation, but there were little other differences in outcomes. They concluded that rate control was preferable. There were a number of problems with the review and the conclusion may not, therefore, be reliable.
