Diffusion tensor imaging in schizophrenia
CRD SUMMARY: The review examined the potential of diffusion tensor imaging to detect differences in fractional anisotropy between schizophrenic and normal patients. The authors concluded that no consistent differences could be identified. The lack of review methods and absence of a quality assessment made it difficult to assess the evidence, but these conclusions appear reasonable given the limitations of the data presented.
