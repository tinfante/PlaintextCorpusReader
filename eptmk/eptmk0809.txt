Project towards no drug abuse: a review of the findings and future directions.
OBJECTIVE: To provide a review of the evidence from 3 experimental trials of Project Towards No Drug Abuse (TND), a senior-high-school-based drug abuse prevention program.
METHODS: Theoretical concepts, subjects, designs, hypotheses, findings, and conclusions of these trials are presented. A total of 2,468 high school youth from 42 schools in southern California were surveyed.
RESULTS: The Project TND curriculum shows reductions in the use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, hard drugs, weapon carrying, and victimization. Most of these results were replicated across the 3 trials.
CONCLUSION: Project TND is an effective drug and violence prevention program for older teens, at least for one-year follow-up.
