Use of remifentanil as a sedative agent in critically ill adult patients: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that the available evidence did not support the use of remifentanil as a sedative agent in critically-ill adult patients. The authors' conclusions reflected the evidence presented. Given a number of review weaknesses (small sample sizes, potential for publication bias, and poor quality of included trials), the reliability of the conclusions is uncertain.
