[Treatment of condyloma acuminatum with 0.5% 5-fluorouracil-solution, A double-blind clinical trial]
30 males and 29 females with condyloma acuminatum took part in a double-blind randomized trial with 0,5% 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) salicylic acid containing varnish for warts versus the varnish without 5-FU. The females were treated twice weekly at the clinic, the males were treated once daily at home by themselves. The 5-FU solution was found significantly superior to placebo (P less than 0,01). 60% of the 5-FU treated patients were healed with a median healing time of two weeks in the males and three weeks in the females. In the placebo group 27,6% healed with a median healing time of 2,5 weeks (males) an 3,5 weeks (females). Blood tests obtained before and after the trial were normal. Patch tests with 0,5% 5-FU revealed no sensitization after the therapy.
