Can cycloidal vibration plus standard treatment reduce lower limb cellulitis treatment times?
OBJECTIVE: This single-centre non-blind randomised controlled trial aimed to compare clinical outcomes in terms of recovery time of standard treatment of lower limb cellulitis versus standard treatment combined with cycloidal vibration (Vibro-Pulse) therapy. METHOD: Thirty-six patients (18 per group) with lower limb cellulitis were randomised to receive either standard treatment (intravenous or oral antibiotic therapy) and bed rest or standard treatment combined with cycloidal vibration treatment three times per day, 30 minutes per treatment. The outcome measure was the daily amount of reduction in erythema/cellulitis and oedema reduction against time for up to seven days of treatment and the resources required. RESULTS: There was a clinically significant difference between the two groups, with 66% of the study group fully recovering within the seven days compared with 11% of the control group. CONCLUSION: Cycloidal vibration combined with standard therapy can significantly reduce cellulitis treatment time. This can reduce both hospital bed days and the resources required.
