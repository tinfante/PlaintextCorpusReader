Systematic review of adjuvant care for women with stage I ovarian carcinoma
CRD SUMMARY: This review aimed to determine the optimal strategy of adjuvant therapy in stage 1 ovarian cancer. There was some evidence that adjuvant chemotherapy improved 5-year overall and disease-free survival, but insufficient evidence to recommend radiotherapy. Surgical staging of suspected cases and further research is needed. The generalisability of the conclusions is uncertain given the insufficient reporting of review methods and study details.
