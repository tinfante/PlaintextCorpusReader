Fluvoxamine versus desipramine: comparative polysomnographic effects.
Electroencephalogram sleep measures over a 4-week period were obtained on 35 inpatients with major depression (unipolar) who received either fluvoxamine or desipramine in a randomized double-blind trial. Fluvoxamine showed immediate rapid eye movement (REM) sleep suppression and an alerting effect on sleep continuity measures. In contrast, desipramine administration was associated with REM suppression and sleep continuity improvement. The "alerting" quality of fluvoxamine, similar to other serotonergic antidepressants, appears to be unrelated to a lack of clinical efficacy, but may be related to persistent REM sleep suppression. However, it is premature to comment on the serotonin specificity for REM sleep.
