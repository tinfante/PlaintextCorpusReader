Transarterial chemoembolization in combination with percutaneous ablation therapy in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This generally well-conducted review concluded that transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined with percutaneous ablation therapy (especially percutaneous ethanol injection) improved the overall survival status of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Given a number of issues concerning the limited quality and clinical variation of the evidence, the authors' conclusion should be interpreted with caution.
