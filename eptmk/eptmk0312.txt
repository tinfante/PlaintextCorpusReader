Mianserin in the treatment of depression in general practice.
In a double-blind study in general practice, both mianserin ('Bolvidon') in an average dose of 40 mg a day, and imipramine, in an average dose of 100 mg a day, were found to be significantly more effective than placebo after two to three weeks' treatment. No significant differences in antidepressant effect could be demonstrated between mianserin and imipramine. There was no significant difference in side-effects between the three treatments.
