Diagnostic accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography, helical computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging for suspected thoracic aortic dissection: systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The article reported a well-conducted systematic review assessing the accuracy of transoesophageal echocardiography, helical computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing thoracic aortic dissection (in comparison with findings at surgery, autopsy or angiography). The authors concluded that all three imaging modalities are equally reliable for confirming or ruling out thoracic aortic dissection; this conclusion accurately reflects the data presented.
