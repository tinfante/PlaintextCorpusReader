A three-year clinical comparison of a sodium monofluorophosphate dentifrice with sodium fluoride dentifrices on dental caries in children.
This study compared the anticaries effects of these three fluoride-containing dentifrices: 1100 ppm F as NaF (positive control); 2800 ppm F as SMFP; and 2800 ppm F as NaF. The group using the 2800 SMFP dentifrice showed no significant differences in DMFS or DMFT, compared to the positive control, at anytime during the study. This indicated that higher levels of sodium monofluorophosphate in a dentifrice offer no advantage in caries protection over the conventional level of sodium fluoride, 1100 ppm F.
