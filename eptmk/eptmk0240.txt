Results and complications after ileal pouch anal anastomosis: a meta-analysis of 43 observational studies comprising 9,317 patients
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed complications and functional outcomes after ileal pouch anal anastomosis. The authors concluded that the complication rates with current surgical techniques are significant and there is room for improvement. The review supports the authors' conclusions, but the reliability of the evidence is weakened by the limited search and the use of observational data with no comparison groups.
