A controlled study of acupuncture in neck pain.
Twenty-five out-patients with chronic neck pain participated in a prospective, randomized trial of acupuncture versus placebo transcutaneous nerve stimulation. A single-blind, non-cross-over design incorporated several outcome measures in an attempt to determine any particular facet of pain that responded to acupuncture. No significant difference between the two treatments was found either post-treatment or at follow-up. Whilst the small population studied limits the conclusions that may be drawn, these findings suggest that acupuncture may have no greater effect than that of a powerful placebo.
