Yohimbine for erectile dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials
CRD COMMENTARY: The authors have clearly stated their research question and some inclusion and exclusion criteria. The literature search appears thorough. The quality of the included studies was formally assessed and the authors have also reported on how the articles were selected, and how many of the reviewers were involved in the data selection and quality assessment.
The data extraction is reported in tables and text. Across studies the effect sizes ranged from 34 to 73% which suggests heterogeneity between studies. The authors suggest that this could be due to differences in the included patients (e.g. patients with different types of erectile dysfunction (organic, non-organic, psychogenic). Because of the variability across results, statistical pooling was not appropriate.
