LHRH analogues for ovulation induction, with particular reference to polycystic ovary syndrome.
Infertile women with PCO have been treated with exogenous gonadotrophins (hMG/hCG) for ovulation induction either with or without LHRH-agonist treatment. Those treated without LHRH-agonist-induced LH suppression showed PL in greater than 30% of the cycles and this problem was eliminated by LHRH-agonist therapy. The pregnancy rate (approximately 80% of patients) during the combined therapy was approximately twice that of the group treated with hMG/hCG alone. The suppression of endogenous LH by the LHRH-agonist appeared to have no effect upon the profiles of follicular development in response to hMG, and a high rate of follicle recruitment characterized all PCO treatment cycles irrespective of circulating LH concentrations. These results suggest that LH suppression improves the efficacy of ovulation induction but has no influence on the primary metabolic disturbance in the PCO syndrome.
