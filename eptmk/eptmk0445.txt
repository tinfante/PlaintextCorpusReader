Utility of blood pressure monitoring outside of the clinic setting
CRD COMMENTARY: The questions and the inclusion criteria were clear for this substantial review. The search strategy was comprehensive in its consultation with a number of databases and additional material. However, the restriction to English language articles may mean that important studies might have been missed, and there was no evidence that publication bias was assessed. Other potential sources of bias were noted in the review process; specifically the apparent lack of independent (and non-blinded) assessment at the study selection, data extraction and validity assessment stages. Although the study details were reported extensively and the results were clearly synthesised according to research question, there was no clear summary of study quality. Together with the fact that many of the findings were based on studies with substantial heterogeneity and inconsistent levels of reporting, the reliability of the conclusions is unclear. However, the authors substantiated this as a likely reflection of practice and offered a comprehensive list of recommendations for future research.
