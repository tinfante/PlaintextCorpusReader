Diabetes patient education: a meta-analysis and meta-regression
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the effectiveness of patient education on glycaemic control in adults with diabetes. The authors concluded that educational interventions have a modest improvement in glycaemic control, while face-to-face delivery, cognitive reframing teaching and exercise content increase the likelihood of success. The lack of a validity assessment and details of the control interventions weaken this conclusion.
