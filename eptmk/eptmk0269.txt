Coronary risk factor behavior change in hospital personnel following a screening program.
We conducted a worksite cardiovascular disease (CVD) awareness and education program at a large medical center. The program consisted of employee screening for blood pressure and total serum cholesterol level, dissemination of information on risk factors for CVD, counseling on behavior change, and evaluation of the screening event as an educational tool. During this five-day event, 2,284 employees were screened for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Consenting employees completed a health risk appraisal survey (n = 2,255) and received counseling on their results and CVD risk factors. Appropriate referrals to health care professionals and educational programs were made according to national guidelines. We developed three-month and six-month follow-up surveys and distributed them to all participating employees. The analysis of these data suggests some positive impact upon behavior change within this employee population. In addition to the two follow-up surveys, we held a second blood pressure and serum cholesterol screening eight months after the initial screening. Comparison of the levels taken from both screenings (n = 234) suggests that worksite screening programs may influence significant serum cholesterol and blood pressure reductions in high-risk employees.
