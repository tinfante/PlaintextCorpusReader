Streptokinase and Heparin in the Treatment of Pulmonary Embolism: A Randomized Comparison
Treatment with streptokinase followed by heparin was compared on a randomized basis with treatment with heparin alone in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. The diagnosis and results of treatment were established by pulmonary angiography. Fifteen patients received streptokinase and 16 received heparin alone. Complications included bleeding and pyrexia in both treatment groups and anaphylaxis in a patient receiving streptokinase. There were three deaths attributed to the disease its treatment. Patients in the strepto kinase group had significantly greater angiographic improvement (P = 0.0125) than those in the heparin group.
