Prospective, controlled study of a polyvalent pseudomonas vaccine in cystic fibrosis--three year results.
Thirty four children with cystic fibrosis allocated to pseudomonas vaccine and control groups were studied for three years. No significant differences were observed in the numbers colonised by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or in the overall disease progress of the two groups.
