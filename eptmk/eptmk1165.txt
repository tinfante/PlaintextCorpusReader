Scaling up collaborative TB-HIV activities in Latin America.
TB-HIV collaborative activities are one of the cornerstones of TB control in the Stop TB strategy. Since 2003, most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have been gradually implementing TB-HIV collaborative activities; however, limited information is currently available on the degree of implementation. This study is therefore aimed at describing to what degree TB-HIV collaborative activities are being implemented in 17 countries selected for the study. These countries were asked to complete a semi-structured questionnaire. An analysis of this questionnaire revealed that the challenges for TB-HIV collaboration lie in the fields of human resources, surveillance and HIV testing of TB patients.
