Newer hypnotic drugs for the short-term management of insomnia: a systematic review and economic evaluation
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone with benzodiazepines (licensed and used in the UK) for the short-term management of insomnia. The authors concluded that short-acting drugs (Z-drugs) seemed equally effective and safe, but that there was a clear need for further research in this area. The authors suggested interpreting the findings with considerable caution, and their recommendation for further research seems appropriate.
