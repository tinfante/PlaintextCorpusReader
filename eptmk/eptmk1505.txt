Evaluating smoking cessation interventions and cessation rates in cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The review concluded that smoking cessation rates in cancer patients were not improved by various interventions compared with usual care. A combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches may be more successful. Limitations in the review reporting and the lack of quality assessment make the reliability of the authors' conclusions uncertain.
