Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) followed by surgery with surgery alone for patients with oesophageal cancer. The authors concluded that NCRT was associated with a small nonsignificant improvement in survival, but further research is needed. Limitations in review methods and reporting mean that it is not possible to independently endorse these conclusions.
