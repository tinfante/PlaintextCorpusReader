Thiamine status, vitamin supplements and postoperative confusion.
In a prospective, randomized, controlled study an intravenous vitamin B complex and vitamin C preparation was administered pre- and post-operatively to 28 elderly patients with a fractured proximal femur and compared with 32 nonsupplemented postoperative controls. Vitamin supplementation significantly, though only transiently, improved postoperative thiamine status (P less than 0.001), but had no influence on mental state or outcome during the postsurgical period. Therefore, the use of parenteral vitamins for postoperative confusion cannot be justified on a routine basis.
