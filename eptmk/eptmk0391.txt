Subcutaneous treatment of deep venous thrombosis with low molecular weight heparin. A dose finding study with LMWH-Novo.
Treatment of deep venous thrombosis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH-Novo, Logiparin) was carried out with two different doses of Logiparin, 75 XaI U/kg b.w. twice daily and 150 XaI U/kg b.w. once daily subcutaneously for 5 days. Simultaneously warfarin was given from the first day of heparin treatment. Mean age of the twenty patients was 65 years and one third was females. No serious side effects, hematomas, pulmonary emboli or signs of recurrent thrombosis occurred during treatment with either dose regime. Venografic assessment with Marder scoring one week after initiation of Logiparin treatment showed a slight not significant improvement apparent in 40% of the patients. The activities of F-IIaI and F-XaI in the blood plasma were found to increase after injection of Logiparin. These two parameters seem to be the most suitable for monitoring the effect during treatment. For future studies on the therapeutic effect of Logiparin in deep venous thrombosis a single dose of 150 to 200 F-XaI activity per 24 hours seems to be most suitable.
