Evaluation of a ghetto school breakfast program.
A program was initiated to provide a free breakfast at a ghetto elementary school. Community support was achieved at the expense of randomization of study subjects. While no significantly greater increase in school attendance or performance was detected in comparison with a control school, none of the students was malnourished and diets of students in the control school were as adequate as those in the breakfast school. Thus, it cannot be concluded that school breakfast programs would not benefit malnourished children or teen-agers who most often go without breakfast.
