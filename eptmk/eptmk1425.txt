Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in older adults: a review of the evidence
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that there is limited evidence to suggest that high-risk elderly patients without a known risk of coronary artery disease may benefit from statin treatment, but more trials are needed. Overall, despite the poor reporting of the review methods, the authors' cautious conclusions and recommendations for further research appear reliable given the limitations of the included data.
