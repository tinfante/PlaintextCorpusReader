Computed tomographic angiography for detecting cerebral aneurysms: implications of aneurysm size distribution for the sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios
CRD SUMMARY: This review aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomographic angiography (CTA), compared with intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography or surgical findings, for the detection of cerebral aneurysms after adjusting for size distributions. The author concluded that CTA is useful in the descriptive imaging of a known aneurysm. Although the author's conclusions appear consistent with the results obtained, methodological limitations may restrict interpretation.
