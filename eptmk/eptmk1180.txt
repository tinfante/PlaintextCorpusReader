In-home online support for caregivers of survivors of stroke: a feasibility study.
The primary aim of this feasibility study was to determine if caregivers (n = 5) were willing and able to use Caring-Web, a Web-based intervention for support, from their home Internet connection for 3 months. The caregivers' perceived health and satisfaction with caring, as well as the care recipients' use of healthcare services, were recorded. The experience of caring (problems and successes) was examined. Data were collected via weekly online surveys and e-mail discussions. Descriptive analyses revealed that the 3 caregivers who completed the study were satisfied with Caring-Web. Caregivers rated their health as average to excellent and their satisfaction with caring as good. Care recipients averaged 6 calls/visits to a medical office with one emergency room visit and subsequent hospitalization. Major problems for the caregivers included dealing with medical conditions about which they lacked knowledge. Content analysis of the e-mail discussions revealed that subjects sought information about medical conditions related to caring for the survivor of the stroke. Major successes for the caregivers involved communicating effectively with the care recipient and returning to everyday life with family and friends.
