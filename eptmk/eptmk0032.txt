[The results of randomized controlled trial of low-dose radiation for wet-type age-related macular degeneration on a 1 year term basis]
OBJECT: Evaluation of low dose radiation therapy to the wet-type age-related macular degeneration (AMD) located at the fovea centralis. CASES AND METHODS: Patients were irradiated with 10 fractions of 2 Gy external beam or just observed. Between the treated(39) and untreated (31) cases, there was no significant difference in gender, age, initial visual acuity, or size of the neovascular membrane. RESULTS: With the follow-up of 12 months, the visual acuity was significantly well preserved and the size of the neovascular membrane was decreased. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that low dose irradiation is effective for the wet-type AMD of the stage we treated in the present study.
