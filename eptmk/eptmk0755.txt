Contemporary treatments for twin-twin transfusion syndrome
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared laser coagulation, amnioreduction, septostomy and foeticide for twin-twin transfusion syndrome. The authors concluded that laser coagulation appeared to reduce perinatal mortality and morbidity more than serial amnioreduction, but there were insufficient data to evaluate septostomy and selective foeticide. The authors' cautious conclusions appear to accurately reflect the evidence, which was from predominantly non-randomised observational studies.
