Daily or alternate-day FSH therapy in patients with polycystic ovarian disease resistant to clomiphene citrate treatment.
The effectiveness of intramuscular follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) administered as daily or alternate-day injections to patients with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) who previously failed to ovulate on clomiphene citrate was compared. The study comprised 20 treatment cycles of daily FSH and 19 of alternate-day FSH in 12 patients. The overall ovulation rate per cycle was 78% and was similar for both groups. Nine out of 12 patients achieved a pregnancy, with twice as many occurring in the alternate-day group. It is concluded that alternate-day FSH therapy is as effective as daily FSH in achieving ovulation and pregnancies in patients with PCOD resistant to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
