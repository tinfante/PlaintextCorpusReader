Outcomes of single-row and double-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review found a possible structural healing benefit for double-row compared to single-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, but little evidence to support any functional differences except possibly for patients with large tears. Due to limitations of the evidence and because the result about large tears was from a subgroup analysis, the review conclusions should be treated with caution.
