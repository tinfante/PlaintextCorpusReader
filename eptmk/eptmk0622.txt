Evaluation of lithium therapy for alcoholism.
The efficacy of lithium therapy for alcoholism was examined in 84 alcoholic volunteers admitted for rehabilitation. Subjects were randomly assigned to a lithium or placebo treatment condition for 18 months, and were reinterviewed monthly to document their compliance, drinking status, and mood. Two separate factors contributed to abstinent outcome: therapeutic serum lithium levels (greater than or equal to 0.4 mEq/L) and medication compliance. Recommendations are proposed for studying compliance effects in future treatment studies.
