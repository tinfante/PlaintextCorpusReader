Cell salvage auto transfusion in total knee replacement surgery.
We conducted a prospective, randomized study to assess the impact of cell salvage, auto transfusion on the requirements for allogeneic blood for patients undergoing a total knee replacement (TKR). One hundred consecutive TKR patients were randomly allocated to receive either autologous blood (using cell salvage) or an allogeneic blood transfusion as necessary. Patients allocated to the autologous group were rescued with allogeneic blood if the postoperative haemoglobin fell below 9 g dL-1. Forty-two (84%) of 50 patients in the autologous group required no supplementary blood transfusion. Forty (80%) of 50 patients allocated to receive allogeneic blood required transfusion. There were no detrimental effects of autologous blood transfusion. We conclude that autologous blood transfusion, using the cell saver system, is a safe and effective method of reducing the need for allogeneic blood transfusion and, in doing so, reduces the risk of transmission of infections associated with allogeneic blood transfusion, whilst decreasing demand on precious allogeneic blood reserves.
