A randomized comparison of glycerol-impregnated chromic catgut with untreated chromic catgut for the repair of perineal trauma.
Glycerol-impregnated chromic catgut and untreated chromic catgut were compared in a randomized controlled trial involving 737 consecutive women who required repair of perineal trauma following spontaneous vaginal delivery. Medical staff preference was equally divided between the two materials. More untreated chromic catgut sutures required removal both by 10 days and by 3 months postpartum. Women whose perineal trauma was repaired with glycerol-impregnated chromic catgut were 10% more likely to have perineal pain at 10 days and 33% more likely to suffer from dyspareunia in the 3 months following delivery. The high rates of maternal morbidity associated with glycerol-impregnated chromic catgut appear to preclude its use for perineal repair.
