Glatiramer acetate reduces the proportion of new MS lesions evolving into "black holes".
The authors evaluated whether glatiramer acetate (GA) modifies the severity of tissue damage in 1,722 new lesions from 239 patients with MS enrolled in a placebo-controlled trial monitored with monthly cerebral MRI. The percentage of new lesions that evolved into "black holes" was lower in GA-treated than in placebo patients on scans at 7 (18.9 and 26.3%; p = 0.04) and 8 (15.6 and 31.4%; p = 0.002) months after lesion appearance. GA has a favorable effect on tissue disruption in MS lesions once they are formed.
