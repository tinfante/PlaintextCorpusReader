Do selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of atherothrombosis: meta-analysis of randomised trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review determined the effect of selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the risk of vascular events. The authors concluded that selective COX-2 inhibitors are associated with a moderate increase in the risk of vascular events. The lack of detail makes it difficult to judge the extent to which variation between the studies impacted upon the results.
