Single site laparoscopic right hemicolectomy: an oncological feasible option.
INTRODUCTION: We present the first 7 cases of single site right hemicolectomy in Asia using the new Single Site Laparoscopy (SSL) access system from Ethicon Endo-surgery.
METHODS: Right hemicolectomy was performed using the new Single Site Laparoscopy (SSL) access system. Patient demographics, operative time, histology and post operative recovery and complications were collected and analysed.
RESULTS: The median operative time was 90 mins (range 60 - 150 mins) and a median wound size of 2.5 cm (range 2 to 4.5 cm). The median number of lymph nodes harvested was 24 (range 20 to 34 lymph nodes). The median length of proximal margin was 70 mm (range 30 to 145 mm) and that of distal margin was 50 mm (35 to 120 mm). All patients had a median hospital stay of 7 days (range 5 to 11) and there were no significant perioperative complications except for 1 patient who had a minor myocardial event.
CONCLUSION: Right hemicolectomy using SSL access system is feasible and safe for oncologic surgery.
