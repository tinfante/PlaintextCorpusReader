New brain lesions after carotid stenting versus carotid endarterectomy: a systematic review of the literature
CRD SUMMARY: The review assessed the incidence of new brain lesions identified using diffusion-weighted imaging following either carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) or carotid endarterectomy and found CAS to be associated with significantly more new lesions after surgery. The authors' conclusions reflected the evidence presented, but potential biases in the review methodology made the reliability of the conclusions uncertain.
