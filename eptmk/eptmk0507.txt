The impact of education groups for people with schizophrenia on social functioning and quality of life.
BACKGROUND:   Education groups for people with schizophrenia have tended to concentrate on compliance with medication. This study examines impact on social behaviour and quality of life.  METHOD:   A catchment-wide service was set up for community-based patients. Patients who indicated an interest in education groups were randomly allocated to either an education group or a waiting list control group. Those who attended groups were compared with the control group.  RESULTS:   About one-quarter of community-based patients showed interest in attending education groups. Those who attended showed no change in mental state or compliance with medication (already high) but significant gains in quality of life, social functioning and social networks.  CONCLUSIONS:   For patients who choose to attend education groups significant gains in social functioning and quality of life are possible without specific skills training.
