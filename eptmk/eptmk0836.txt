A long-term follow-up of 60 Lord total hip arthroplasties in rheumatic disease: a mean follow-up of 14 years.
The aim of the study was to analyse the survivorship of 60 total hip arthroplasties using the cementless Lord prosthesis in 51 patients with inflammatory joint disease. Patients were operated on between the years 1985 and 1988. The mean follow-up time was 13.8 (4.0-18.6) years. During the follow-up, one deep infection was encountered, and seven patients died of causes unrelated to the hip replacement. Revision surgery or death of the patient was used as an end point. The overall survival was 88.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 76.6-94.1] for the stem, and 64.3% (95% CI 50.6-75.1) for the cup at 15 years. Causes for revision surgery were loosening of the cup in 17 hips, loosening of both components in five hips, and one deep infection.
