Surgical Maze procedure as a treatment for atrial fibrillation: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that surgical Maze procedures were associated with a decrease in atrial fibrillation within 12 months of surgery without an increase in length of hospital stay, perioperative complications or mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation.The possibility of publication bias and lack of information on the quality of included trials creates some uncertainty about the robustness of the authors' conclusions.
