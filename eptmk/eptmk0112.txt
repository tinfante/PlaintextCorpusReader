Postpartum insertion of modified intrauterine devices.
The immediate postpartum insertion of standard intrauterine devices (IUDs) and those specially modified for postpartum use was evaluated in a multicenter clinical trial. The immediate postpartum insertion of IUDs was not associated with any increased risk of perforation or infection, although expulsion rates were higher than with interval insertions. The expulsion rate varied widely between centers using similar devices, suggesting that training in insertion is essential. Postpartum IUD insertions can be a practical contraceptive option for patients and providers of medical services.
