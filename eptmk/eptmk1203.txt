Evidence-based psychosocial treatments for eating problems and eating disorders.
Eating disorders represent a significant source of psychological impairment among adolescents. However, most controlled treatment studies have focused on adult populations. This review provides a synthesis of existing data concerning the efficacy of various psychosocial interventions for eating disorders in adolescent samples. Modes of therapy examined in adolescent samples include family therapy, cognitive therapy, behavioral therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy mostly in patients with anorexia nervosa. At this time, the evidence base is strongest for the Maudsley model of family therapy for anorexia nervosa. Evidence of efficacy for other treatments and other conditions is limited by several methodological factors including the small number of studies, failure to use appropriate control conditions or randomization procedures, and small sample sizes (i.e., fewer than 10 participants per treatment arm). Potential moderators and mediators of treatment effect are reviewed. Finally, results from adolescent studies are contrasted with those from adult studies of eating disorders treatment. Many studies of adult populations comprise late adolescent/young adult participants, suggesting that findings regarding the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa in adults likely extend to older adolescent populations.
