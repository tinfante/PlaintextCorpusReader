A comparative clinical trial of Copper T 220 C and Alza T IPCS 52 intrauterine devices in Thai women.
Two IUDs (Copper T 220 C and Alza T IPCS 52) were comparatively studied by randomized insertions in 200 Thai women who attended the Family Planning Clinic at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University. Point estimates of the pregnancy rate and rate of removal for bleeding and pain at 18 months were lower for the copper device than for the Alza T IPCS 52, but neither these nor any other pertinent event rates reached statistical significance. Study of the Alza device was halted before the completion of 2 years because reports from other centres indicated an unacceptable pregnancy rate beyond 2 years.
