Meta-analysis of cholecystectomy in symptomatic patients with positive hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan results without gallstones
CRD SUMMARY: The review found that among patients without gallstones, but with right upper quadrant pain and a positive hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan, cholecystectomy was more likely to relieve symptoms than medical treatment. In view of probable selection bias, poor reporting of study characteristics, clinical differences between studies and high levels of statistical heterogeneity, the conclusions may not be reliable.
