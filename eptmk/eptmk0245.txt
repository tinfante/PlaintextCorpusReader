Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of the timing of tracheostomy in adult patients undergoing artificial ventilation
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared early and late tracheostomy in patients undergoing prolonged artificial ventilation. The authors concluded that performing a tracheostomy earlier may shorten the duration of artificial ventilation and length of stay in the intensive care unit. The lack of methodological detail, the limited number of studies included in the review, and the clinical and statistical heterogeneity identified, mean that the conclusions and implications for practice may not be reliable.
