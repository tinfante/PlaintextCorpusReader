Mumps outbreaks in vaccinated populations: are available mumps vaccines effective enough to prevent outbreaks?

The authors concluded that more effective mumps vaccines were needed. Given the types of studies included, the reliability of their results is unknown, but the authors' broad conclusions appear to reflect the results.
