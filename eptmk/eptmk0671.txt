Prifinium bromide in the treatment of the irritable colon syndrome.
Eighteen patients with irritable colon syndrome were treated with a new anticholinergic drug (prifinium bromide) and with a placebo in a 6-wk, randomized, double-blind cross-over study. The drug was orally administered in a daily dose of 90 mg before meals. Three manifestations (pain, flatulence, constipation, and/or diarrhea), scored weekly, were used as assessment criteria. Mean over-all ratings showed a difference in favor of the drug, and were statistically significant. Side effects were rare and mild. We have come to the conclusion that this anticholinergic drug may be of benefit to patients with pain-predominant forms of irritable colon syndrome.
