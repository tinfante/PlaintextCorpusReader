Adding low-dose cyclosporin A to parenteral gold therapy in rheumatoid arthritis: a double-blind placebo-controlled study.
A double-blind, randomized comparison between parenteral gold therapy (PGT) and cyclosporin A (CyA) vs PGT and placebo during 6 months was performed in 40 RA patients experiencing a decreasing effect of ongoing PGT. Patients' overall assessment of health was the only efficacy variable significantly better in the CyA- and PGT-treated vs the placebo- and PGT-treated group. Higher blood pressure and more signs of renal impairment were found during the 6 months treatment in the former compared with the latter group. Six months after the end of the combination therapy, a higher potassium value in the CyA-treated group was the only difference. In conclusion, no effects additional to those expected with single-drug therapy or additional risks of side-effects of either drug were found when combining low-dose CyA with ongoing PGT in RA patients with long disease duration.
