Statins and all-cause mortality in high-risk primary prevention: a meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials involving 65229 participants
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that statin therapy for an average period of 3.7 years did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality in a high-risk primary prevention population. The authors acknowledged certain limitations with the included trials and statistical analyses. Despite the potential for bias in the review, the authors' conclusions appear to reflect the evidence, based on a large sample population.
