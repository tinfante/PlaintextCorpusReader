Is heparin contraindicated in pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy?
PURPOSE: We initiated a prospective study to verify or refute the complications of lymphocele formation and excessive blood loss associated with heparin prophylaxis in pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was completed on 579 men undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy usually in association with radical prostatectomy. Patients were assigned to group 1 (given preoperative and postoperative subcutaneous heparin) and group 2 (no heparin). All patients were evaluated 2 to 3 weeks after surgery with ultrasound for pelvic lymphocele. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the number or size of pelvic lymphoceles or blood loss in group 1 versus group 2. CONCLUSIONS: The use of heparin prophylaxis to prevent thromboembolic complications in conjunction with pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy is not associated with increased blood loss or increased rate of lymphocele formation.
