SSRIs during breastfeeding: spotlight on milk-to-plasma ratio
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that there is no evidence to support the suggestion that antidepressant drugs of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor class that have a low milk-to-plasma ratio should be preferred for breast-feeding women. Although the review suffered from a number of limitations, the conclusions are supported by the data presented and are likely to be reliable.
