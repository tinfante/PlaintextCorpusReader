The diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography angiography for traumatic or atherosclerotic lesions of the carotid and vertebral arteries: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This well-conducted review assessed the accuracy of computed tomography angiography (CTA) for imaging carotid and vertebral arteries. It found that CTA is both a sensitive and specific imaging technique for identifying severe atherosclerotic stenosis and occlusion of the carotid arteries. There was insufficient evidence to determine the accuracy of CTA in the setting of blunt or penetrating trauma.
