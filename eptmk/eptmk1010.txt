HIV testing: changing trends at a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases in London.
Trends in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) counselling and antibody testing at a London clinic for sexually transmitted diseases showed substantial changes over a 12 month period. From around 100 a month in the summer of 1986 the numbers of people attending rose substantially to 276 in October 1986 and 475 in November at the time of the campaign in the popular press. They rose further still, to 700, at the time of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) week in March 1987. In April they fell to the levels seen six months previously. Apart from this increase in overall numbers the proportions of women and heterosexual men who were seen increased.
