Postoperative blood salvage in total hip and knee arthroplasty. A randomised controlled trial.
We undertook a prospective controlled clinical trial of 109 patients to determine whether postoperative blood salvage in patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty decreased the need for transfusion with banked blood. The average amount of blood collected in our series was 493 ml, most of which was collected in the first four postoperative hours. In patients undergoing bilateral total knee arthroplasty, there was a 54% reduction in banked blood utilisation. None of our patients developed adverse effects from the reinfused material. The cost of collecting and processing wound drainage using the Haemolite cell washer was $175 per patient, regardless of the volume processed, compared to $125 for a unit of banked blood. By reducing the requirement for homologous transfusion, blood salvage diminishes the risks of transmission of HIV and hepatitis viruses. In those cases where the equivalent of two units of blood are reinfused, blood salvage saves money. However, due to the small amounts of blood collected in unilateral hip or knee arthroplasty, we do not recommend its routine application in these cases.
