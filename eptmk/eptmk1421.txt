Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that comparative data of intensity modulated radiotherapy with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy appeared to support the theory that higher doses can improve biochemical survival with localised prostate cancer. These conclusions should be interpreted with caution due to the possibility of language bias, limited quality of the included studies and a lack of rigour in the review process.
