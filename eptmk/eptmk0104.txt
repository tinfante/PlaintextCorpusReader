Radical radiotherapy for inoperable non-small cell lung cancer: what factors predict prognosis?
We set out to determine the factors that predict the outcome of conventional radical radiotherapy for inoperable non-small cell lung cancer. A retrospective casenote review was carried out of all 69 patients treated between 1986 and 1992 at the Northern Ireland Centre for Clinical Oncology, Belfast, with radical radiotherapy for inoperable non-small cell lung cancer. The tumour dose ranged from 45 Gy to 67.5 Gy, delivered in 15-30 fractions, 5 days per week over 3-6 weeks. All patients were followed up for 5 years. The disease was TNM Stage T1-T4N0-N2M0. The majority of tumours (51) were squamous. Overall survival was 63.8% (44-patients; 95% confidence interval (CT) 51.3-75.2) at one year; median survival was 16 months and 5-year survival was 13% (nine patients; 95% CI 6.1-23.3). Five-year survival for the 36 patients with stage T1 or T2 disease was 5.6% (2 patients). Five-year survival for the 33 patients with stage T3 or T4 disease, all with tumours at or near the carina, was 21.2% (seven patients). A WHO performance status of 0 or 1 (P = 0.03, Cox proportional hazards model) was associated with a better chance of survival.
