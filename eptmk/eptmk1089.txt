Comparison of colonic stenting and open surgery for malignant large bowel obstruction
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that stenting was an effective palliative treatment for malignant obstruction of the large bowel, with short hospital stays and low rates of stoma formation in comparison with open surgery. The conclusions were based on the statistical combination of data from randomised and non-randomised studies and the results differed between studies; the reliability of these conclusions is therefore unclear.
