Effect of reminiscence therapy on depression in older adults: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effect of reminiscence therapy on depression in older adults. The authors concluded that this intervention may be an effective treatment for this group. However, the methods used to conduct the review were not well reported, and minimal results were presented. The evidence available is therefore weak and the conclusions reflect this.
