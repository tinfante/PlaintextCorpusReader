Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia with omega-3 fatty acids: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that the limitations of the available trials made it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, in the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia, in otherwise healthy people. The review had some limitations, but the authors' cautious conclusions reflect the evidence presented and seem appropriate.
