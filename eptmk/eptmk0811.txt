Face mask physiotherapy in cystic fibrosis.
The use of the 'PEP' mask with forced expiratory coughing was compared with conventional physiotherapy over a one month period. No difference was shown in symptom scores, sputum production, or simple lung function tests. The mask was well accepted and allowed independent treatment by older patients.
