Prophylactic cranial irradiation in small cell lung cancer
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that prophylactic cranial irradiation may prevent brain metastases and increase disease-free and overall survival in people with small-cell lung cancer who have achieved complete response after induction therapy. There was insufficient evidence to recommend an optimal dose. Although information on the methods used was sparse, the findings are likely to be valid.
