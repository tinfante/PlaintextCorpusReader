Effects of inhaled corticosteroids on mortality and hospitalisation in elderly asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients: appraising the evidence
CRD SUMMARY: This review examined the mortality and hospitalisation rates associated with the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The authors concluded that lower rates of hospitalisation and mortality were found to be associated with ICS use. However, concerns about potential biases in the review data mean that the findings are unlikely to be robust.
