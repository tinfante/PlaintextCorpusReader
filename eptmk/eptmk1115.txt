Efficacy and co-morbidity of oral appliances in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the efficacy and safety of oral appliances (OAs) in obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome. The authors concluded that OAs are a feasible treatment, although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) appeared more effective and adverse effects were reported with OAs. The review was reasonably well conducted, but there was insufficient evidence to directly compare CPAP with mandibular repositioning appliances and to support the authors' conclusions.
