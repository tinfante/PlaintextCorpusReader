Low dose heparin versus low molecular weight heparin (Kabi 2165, Fragmin) in the prophylaxis of thromboembolic complications of abdominal oncological surgery.
Eighty patients undergoing pelvic or abdominal surgery for cancer were randomized in two groups for prevention of postoperative thromboembolism: 40 patients received a 15,000 IU day-1 Calciparine prophylaxis and 40 patients a 5000 anti-Xa U/d Fragmin prophylaxis for 10 days. In the Calciparine group, two patients (5%) developed postoperative pulmonary embolism but none developed it in the Fragmin group. Two patients in the Fragmin group (5%) developed isotopic DVT, which was not confirmed by phlebography. There was no deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs in the two groups. Important postoperative bleeding (one patient in the Calciparine group and two patients in the Fragmin group) was similar in both groups. Moderate and minor bleeding were significantly lower in the Fragmin group. Haemoglobin and haematocrit changes, total blood loss and transfusion requirements were not different in both groups. It is concluded that, over a 10-day period, one daily 5000 U Fragmin prophylaxis was as effective and safe as three daily 5000 IU Calciparine injections.
