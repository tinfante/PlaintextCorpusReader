A Public Health Home Intervention among Families of Low Socioeconomic Status
A randomized controlled trial was carried out to test the hypothesis that a schedule of home interventions among mothers of low socioeconomic status would bring about environmental changes in the home, changes that could enhance mother-child interaction The experimental group (N = 21) received three prenatal and five postnatal visits for each visit, specific objectives were determined The control group (N = 26) received the routine postnatal visit The HOME inventory was used as the response measure Although the global HOME score was higher in the experimental group the difference did not reach statistical significance Reasons for the negative results in this study and in similar ones are discussed.
