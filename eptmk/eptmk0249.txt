A systematic review for effective management of central venous catheters and catheter sites in acute care paediatric patients
CRD SUMMARY: This systematic review found a paucity of evidence relating to the management of central venous catheters (CVCs) in paediatric care. The authors concluded that there was inconclusive evidence for the use of prophylactic vancomycin in paediatric patients with CVCs. The authors' limited conclusions reflect the lack of evidence.
