A randomized study of a domiciliary antenatal care scheme: the effect on hospital admissions.
A preliminary randomized study has been made of a domiciliary management scheme which incorporates telephonic fetal heart rate monitoring for women with high-risk pregnancies. In this paper we report effects of the scheme on the pattern of hospital admissions. Sixty women were randomized 2:1 for domiciliary surveillance or for conventional hospital care, with 40 and 17 records finally available for analysis. The groups were well matched for maternal, obstetric and socio-economic characteristics. In the domiciliary group, 21 (53%) of the women avoided hospital admission altogether, the admission rate was more than halved, and the mean proportion of the time spent in hospital was reduced from 50% to 16% of the observation period. The women who received domiciliary care were generally satisfied with the scheme. Our study confirms expectations that carefully planned domiciliary surveillance can reduce the number and duration of hospital admissions.
