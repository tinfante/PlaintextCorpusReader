Progress towards countrywide control of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis in Uganda.
Schistosomiasis caused by infection with Schistosoma mansoni is a serious public health burden in 38 of the 56 districts of Uganda. This article reviews the initial experience of the national control programme. Launched in 2003, this started with a pilot phase with the main aim of utilizing the experience to formulate feasible and appropriate methods of drug delivery. Overall, 432,746 people were treated and coverage was 91.4% in schools and 64.7% in communities. The issues raised by independent evaluators included that most communities did not participate in the selection of community drug distributors (CDD) and that teachers and CDDs needed refresher training mainly on health education and the management of side effects. As a way forward, it is suggested that the Ministry of Health should integrate deworming into the existing health infrastructure so that every time a child is reached for any health service, the child is also de-wormed.
