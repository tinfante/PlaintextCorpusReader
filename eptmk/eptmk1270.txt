No difference in risk for thrombocytopenia during treatment of pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis with either low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin: a metaanalysis
CRD SUMMARY: This was a generally well-conducted meta-analysis exploring the risk of thrombocytopenia in patients prescribed low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin for venous thromboembolism. The authors performed a thorough quality assessment of the included studies and used appropriate statistical methods to combine the data. The conclusions seem reliable based on the evidence presented.
