Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hepatic toxicity: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials in arthritis patients
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the hepatic side-effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with arthritis. The authors concluded that NSAIDs did not increase liver-related serious adverse effects, hospitalisation or death, but diclofenac and rofecoxib increased aminotransferase elevations compared with placebo and other NSAIDs examined. The conclusions were drawn from indirect comparisons, hence they may not be robust.
