Deep-vein thrombosis prevention in orthopaedic patients: affecting outcomes through interdisciplinary education.
Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a serious problem that affects millions of people annually. Prophylaxis against DVT following major orthopaedic surgery can save lives and health care dollars. Proper application of the prophylactic regimen by nursing and the interdisciplinary team can be a major key in affecting the outcome of the orthopaedic patient. To obtain successful outcomes, the educational needs of each individual in the interdisciplinary team must be met. Also, being aware of each physician's practice patterns, implementing their individual preferences, and ensuring that all equipment is available and used in a consistent manner will enhance the desired outcome.
