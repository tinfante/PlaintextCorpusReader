Consumer's information needs: results of a national survey.
A national survey conducted in 1995 found that a disturbingly high percentage of Americans do not understand the basic elements of health plans and that people want much more information, particularly about the physicians in the plans and the range of services that are covered. Their most important concern when selecting a health plan is the quality of physicians in the plan, followed by the courtesy of doctors and staff and the freedom to choose their own doctors and hospitals.
