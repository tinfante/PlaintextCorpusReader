Is low-dose haloperidol a useful antiemetic: a meta-analysis of published and unpublished randomized trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effectiveness of haloperidol as an anti-emetic. The authors concluded that single doses of 1 to 2 mg parenteral haloperidol are effective in preventing post-operative nausea and vomiting, as well as nausea and vomiting due to gastrointestinal diseases, and have few side-effects. Given the limited quality of many of the included studies, a more cautious conclusion might have been more appropriate.
