Magnesium prophylaxis for arrhythmias after cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: The authors of this review found that prophylactic magnesium given around the time of cardiac surgery reduced the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias, but had no effect on length of hospital stay or mortality. Given the potential for publication and selection bias, and the pooling of diverse results, the conclusions should be treated with caution.
