Surgical modifications of the upper airway for obstructive sleep apnea in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The review concluded that substantial and consistent reductions in the apnoea-hyponea index were observed following maxillomandibular advancement surgery; adverse events were reported uncommonly. Outcomes following pharyngeal surgery were less consistent; adverse events were reported more commonly. The review had some methodological problems and data limitations, so caution is warranted when interpreting the authors' conclusions.
