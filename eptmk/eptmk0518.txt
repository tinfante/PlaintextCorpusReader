Metabolic and hemodynamic effects of magnesium supplementation in patients with essential hypertension.
The effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure, erythrocyte cation metabolism, and serum lipids was evaluated in 13 patients with mild hypertension. After randomization and a 3-wk placebo run-in period, seven patients received 40 mmol Mg aspartate (20 mmol elemental Mg twice daily) and six received placebo for 3 mo. In comparison with placebo treatment, magnesium aspartate therapy had no effect on blood pressure, lipid concentrations, or erythrocyte cation metabolism. These results demonstrate that in magnesium-repleted hypertensive subjects, magnesium supplementation does not affect blood pressure or lipids probably because magnesium has no effect on cellular cation metabolism in magnesium-replete individuals.
