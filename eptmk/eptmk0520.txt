RAB-plate vs Richards CHS plate for unstable trochanteric hip fractures. A randomized study of 233 patients with 1-year follow-up.
We prospectively randomized 233 patients with unstable trochanteric hip fractures for treatment with a 120 degrees fixed angle blade-plate having a buttress rod (group A, n 111) or a 135 degrees compression hip screw (group B, n 122). The minimum follow-up time was 1 year. The ratio of technical failure was 9% in group A and 19% in group B (p = 0.06). 79 (87%) fractures in group A and 65 (68%) fractures in group B healed without any complication (p = 0.003). Malunion occurred in 2 cases in group A and in 15 cases in group B (p = 0.002).
