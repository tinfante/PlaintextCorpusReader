Non-pharmacological interventions in cognitively impaired and demented patients: a comparison with cholinesterase inhibitors
CRD SUMMARY: The review investigated the effects of non-pharmacological interventions in cognitively impaired and demented elderly patients. The authors concluded that it was likely that these interventions have beneficial effects. The conclusion is reliable, but most of the reported treatment effects were small and most of the included studies were of limited quality.
