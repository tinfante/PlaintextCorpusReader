[Prophylactic use of antibiotics in cesarean section]
The objective of this investigation was to determine the effectiveness of ampicillin administration as a prophylactic regime in patients undergoing cesarean section. A double blind randomized study compared a long course of ampicillin (7 days) to a short course of ampicillin (three doses) to placebo. Thirty one patients were included in the placebo group and sixty patients in the drug groups. Only one patient in the placebo group and one in the drug group developed infectious morbidity. There was no significant difference (p less than 0.001) between the placebo and ampicillin groups.
