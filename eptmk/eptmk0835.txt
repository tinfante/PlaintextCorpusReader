[A double-blind study of the analgesic efficacy in kidney colic of the combination of dipyrone and spasmolytic with ketorolac trometamol].
We conducted a double-blind study in 34 patients to compare the analgesic efficacy in acute renal colic using 2.5 g dipyrone combined with a spasmolytic agent and 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine, diluted in 100 ml saline solution and injected intravenously. Clinical criteria and the observation of red cells in urine were used for the diagnosis. The intensity of the pain and its development were measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) and a scale of items showing patient improvement. The side effects were spontaneously mentioned by the patients and elicited by direct questioning. It can be confirmed with a beta error of 0.10 that the analgesic effect obtained by both treatments is similar. Nevertheless, the combination of dipyrone and spasmolytic produces more side effects, possibly due to the spasmolytic agent.
