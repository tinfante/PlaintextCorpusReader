Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid for treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
The effect of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) on ethanol withdrawal syndrome in alcoholics was investigated in a randomised double-blind study. Patients with withdrawal symptoms were treated either with GHB (orally in a syrup preparation) (11 patients) or with the syrup alone (12). GHB treatment (50 mg/kg) led to a prompt reduction in withdrawal symptoms, such as tremors, sweating, nausea, depression, anxiety, and restlessness. The only side-effect was dizziness. GHB may be useful in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in man.
