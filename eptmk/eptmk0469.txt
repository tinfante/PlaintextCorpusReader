Dipyridamole for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke and other vascular events: a meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the use of dipyridamole, with or without aspirin, for preventing stroke in patients with previous ischaemic cerebrovascular disease. The authors concluded that dipyridamole, with or without aspirin, reduced stroke recurrence in this population. The review appeared to support the authors' conclusions, but the incomplete reporting of review methods makes it difficult to confirm the robustness of the conclusions.
