[Heparin treatment. Comparison between intravenous and subcutaneous administration]
48 patients with acute deep venous thrombosis of the lower limbs were treated with sodium heparin. In 23 patients heparin was injected subcutaneously (s.c.) twice a day and in 25 patients heparin was given by continuous intravenous perfusion (i.v.). Pain and edema disappeared after 8.7 days (s.c.) and 11.7 days (i.v.) respectively. One non fatal pulmonary embolism occurred in each group. A second venography was performed in 24 patients after 7 days of treatment and revealed no difference between the two groups. As judged by repeated thrombin time determination, anticoagulation was ineffective on at least one day in 39% of patients treated subcutaneously and in 60% of patients treated intravenously. The two pulmonary embolisms occurred in patients with ineffective anticoagulation. It is concluded that heparin may be used either intravenously or subcutaneously in the treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis. Thromboembolic complications occurred with both methods of treatment when anticoagulation was ineffective.
