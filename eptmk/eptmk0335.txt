Prevention of thromboembolic complications with miniheparin-dihydroergotamine in patients undergoing lumbar disc operations.
We have evaluated the incidence of bleeding complications using miniheparin (2 X 2500 IU daily)-dihydroergotamine starting preoperatively in a randomized, controlled, prospective, double-blind study in 50 patients undergoing herniated lumbar disc operations. There was no difference in the incidence of intraoperative bleeding problems between the two groups. Preoperatively, 13 patients have been treated in another hospital with conventional low-dose heparin, and of these 13 patients, 7 developed bleeding complications. There were two deep wound hematomas in the placebo group. Early removal of stitches or operative revision of the wound was not necessary in either group. We conclude that the use of minidose heparin-dihydroergotamine is feasible for the prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing herniated lumbar disc operations, since an increased incidence of bleeding complications was not observed. This preventive method should therefore be further clinically evaluated.
