Using motivational interviewing to promote adherence to antiretroviral medications: a pilot study.
This report describes a pilot study of a nursing intervention to increase adherence to combination therapy. The intervention was based on motivational interviewing (MI). Participants completed a baseline assessment using the computer-administered self-interview with audio (ACASI) data collection method and then were randomly assigned to the MI intervention or control condition. Nurse counselors met with participants in the MI intervention group for three adherence sessions. Two months following baseline, participants completed a follow-up assessment. Mean scores on ratings of missed medications were lower for participants in the intervention group than those in the control group. Although there were no significant differences in the number of medications missed during the past 4 days, participants in the MI group reported being more likely to follow the medication regimen as prescribed by their health care provider. The pilot study provided useful information about the acceptability of ACASI and the adequacy of intervention procedures. The results of this pilot study show promise for the use of MI as an intervention to promote adherence to antiretroviral medications.
