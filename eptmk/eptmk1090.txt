Comparison of operative and nonoperative treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures in patients without neurological deficit: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The authors of the review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about operative and non-operative management of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit, and that further good-quality research is required. There were limitations to this review but, overall, the authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable.
