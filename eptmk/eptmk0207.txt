Prevention of deep vein thrombosis in neurosurgical patients: a controlled, randomized trial of external pneumatic compression boots.
A prospective, randomized clinical trial in 95 patients undergoing neurosurgical operative procedures was performed to investigate the efficacy of external pneumatic compression (EPC) of the calves as compared with results in a control group that received no specific form of prophylaxis for prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The diagnosis of DVT was established by the I125 fibrinogen scan and radiographic contrast phlebography. The data indicate that EPC provides significant protection against the development of DVT in comparison with results in the control group (p less than 0.005). There were no known pulmonary emboli in any of the EPC-treated patients. There were no complications of EPC.
