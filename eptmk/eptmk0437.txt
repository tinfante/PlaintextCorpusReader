Dose-dense chemotherapy in nonmetastatic breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: The review found that dose-dense chemotherapy improved overall and disease-free survival in women with non-metastatic breast cancer, at least in those with hormone-receptor negative disease. However, as the authors pointed out, more research is required to investigate whether the findings apply equally to women with hormone-receptor negative and hormone-receptor positive disease.
