Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis used by consultant general surgeons in Scotland.
BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common source of morbidity and mortality in general surgical patients. Guidelines have been produced to help guide doctors through the complex issue of VTE prophylaxis. This study intended to examine the use of VTE prophylaxis amongst general surgeons in Scotland, with reference to nationally produced guidelines. METHOD: A postal questionnaire was sent to all consultant general surgeons in Scotland. They were asked to give their opinion on the best means of VTE prophylaxis in six different clinical scenarios. The responses were evaluated with reference to the guidelines from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). RESULTS: A 69% response rate was achieved. There was a wide variance in the suggested prophylaxis in each of the scenarios. With reference to SIGN guidelines, 35% of responses represented undertreatment, 16% overtreatment and 49% appropriate treatment. CONCLUSION: Despite the publication of VTE guidelines, there is still a wide variety of opinions amongst consultant general surgeons with regards to VTE prophylaxis. Many of the responses were not consistent with such guidelines and represent suboptimal prophylaxis for patients.
