Left ventricular contractility in extremely premature infants in the first day and response to inotropes.
The aim was to assess myocardial contractility in infants born <30 wk gestation developing low systemic blood flow (SBF) in the first day, and the effect of dobutamine versus dopamine. Superior vena cava (SVC) flow was used as a measure of SBF at 3, 10, and 24 h (n = 106). Infants with low SVC flow randomized to dopamine or dobutamine. Myocardial contractility was determined by the relationship between left ventricular (LV) mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (mVcfs) and wall stress. Infants who developed low SVC flow had significantly worse myocardial contractility at 3 h, but not 10 h. At 24 h, low-flow infants had lower than expected mVcfs for any given LV stress. In 37 infants randomized to inotrope, there was no significant difference in contractility at 10 microg/kg/min. At 20 microg/kg/min (n = 21), dopamine increased whereas dobutamine decreased LV stress. Infants on dobutamine had significantly lower than expected mVcfs for any given LV stress compared with infants on dopamine. Contractility was not improved by either inotrope at either dose. In conclusion, infants developing low SVC flow in the first day have worse myocardial contractility at 3 h. Neither inotrope increased contractility, but dopamine increased LV stress at 20 microg/kg/min.
