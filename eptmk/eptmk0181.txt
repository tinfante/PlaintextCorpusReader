Subcutaneous administration of heparin. A randomised comparison with intravenous administration of heparin to patients with deep-vein thrombosis.
One-hundred and forty-one patients with clinical signs of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the legs were randomly allocated to receive heparin either as two daily subcutaneous injections (s.c.) or as continuous intravenous infusion (i.v.). The thrombi extended into the popliteal or femoral veins in 83% of the patients. Verification of diagnosis and evaluation of therapy was performed by phlebography, plethysmography and thermography. The results showed that heparin administered s.c. twice daily was as efficient as continuous i.v. infusion in preventing extension of the thrombus. In two patients the s.c. administration was stopped due to local haematomas at the injection sites. Retroperitoneal or intramuscular bleedings occurred in four patients, two in each group. Two major, non-fatal pulmonary emboli occurred, one in each group.
