Systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography for deep vein thrombosis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the ability of ultrasound investigations to diagnose suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and investigated reasons for differing results between studies. The authors concluded that duplex and triplex ultrasound are best at ruling out DVT in high-risk patients, whilst compression ultrasound is best at ruling in DVT in low-risk patients. The review was well conducted and reported and its conclusions are likely to be reliable.
