The clinical advantages of autologous transfusion. A randomized, controlled study after knee replacement.
We have carried out a randomised, controlled trial on 70 patients having unilateral total knee replacement in which transfusion was either with homologous bank blood or by reinfusion of unwashed blood salvaged after operation. No complications or adverse effects were observed from reinfusion. The need for bank blood was reduced by 86% in the reinfusion group but, more importantly, the number of infective episodes was significantly less when the use of bank blood was avoided. The mean length of stay in hospital was also reduced by more than two days.
