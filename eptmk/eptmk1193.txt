Nicorandil treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that nicorandil treatment as an adjunct to coronary reperfusion therapy improved microvascular function, increased left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume index. In view of the limited search, lack of information on study quality, heterogeneity between studies and possible publication bias, these conclusions should be interpreted with some caution.
