Needlescopic versus laparoscopic appendectomy: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The review found needlescopic appendectomy comparable to laparoscopic appendectomy for hospital stay and perioperative complications, but associated with a longer duration of surgery and a higher conversion rate. The authors' conclusion reflected the evidence presented, but given the small number of included trials of poor methodological quality and with small sample sizes, the reliability of their conclusion is uncertain.
