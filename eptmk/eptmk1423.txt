Loss of antibodies and response to (re-)vaccination in children after treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that chemotherapy in children with acute lymphocytic leukaemia is associated with a temporary reduction in antibody levels against specific diseases and re-vaccination may be required. The evidence was based on a very small number of children in few studies and the results varied widely across studies. This suggests that a more cautious conclusion might be appropriate.
