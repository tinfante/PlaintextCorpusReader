Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (dalteparin) in pregnancy.
Venous thromboembolism remains an important cause of maternal mortality. For women at risk during pregnancy, the recommended venous thromboembolismprophylaxis is unfractionated heparin. Low molecular weight heparins, such as dalteparin, also may be suitable, but randomised trials have not been performed. Pregnant women (105) with confirmed previous or current thromboembolism were randomised to receive either unfractionated heparin twice daily (mean 20569 IU/day) or dalteparin once daily (mean 4631 IU anti-factor Xa units/day) subcutaneously for thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and postpartum period. Recurrence of venous thromboembolism and safety of treatments were assessed. Dalteparin administered once daily was safe and effective in thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and postpartum.
