Risk status and home intervention among children with failure-to-thrive: follow-up at age 4.
Examined the moderating effects of risk status on the impact of home intervention in a follow-up study of children with failure-to-thrive (FTT). Two types of risk (demographic and maternal negative affectivity) and two levels of intervention were examined. In this randomized clinical trial, all children received services in a multidisciplinary growth and nutrition clinic, and half the children also received home visits from a lay home visitor for 1 year. There were no effects of demographic risk, maternal negative affectivity, or intervention status on child outcome at the close of the home intervention. However, at age 4, more than 1 year after the home intervention ended, there were effects of the home intervention on motor development among all children and on cognitive development and behavior during play among children of mothers who reported low levels of negative affectivity. Results highlight the importance of conducting follow-up assessments in the evaluation of home intervention services, and suggest that among low-SES families of children with FTT, home intervention may be most useful among mothers with low negative affectivity.
