A pilot double-blind study of sodium-magnesium EDTA in peripheral vascular disease.
Ten male patients with peripheral vascular disease, Type 2 (LaFontaine), were randomly assigned in a double-blind study to receive either Na2 ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) plus MgSO4, B complex, and vitamin C, or a placebo of MgSO4, B complex, and vitamin C in Ringer's lactate solution. A total of 20 intravenous infusions were planned for administration to each patient. Clinical and laboratory (noninvasive) tests showed dramatic improvements after 10 infusions in some patients, and thus was broken the code indicating who was receiving EDTA and who was receiving placebo. The group that improved had been receiving EDTA; there was no change in the placebo group. The trial was then completed in a single-blind fashion. Patients originally assigned to receive placebo then received 10 EDTA infusions, while the group originally assigned to EDTA received 20 EDTA infusions. The group that had formerly received placebo showed improvements comparable to those seen in the first EDTA group after 10 treatments.
