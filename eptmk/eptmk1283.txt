Effects of postoperative, nonsteroidal, antiinflammatory drugs on bleeding risk after tonsillectomy: meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the risk of bleeding associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs given to relieve pain after tonsillectomy. The authors concluded that these drugs increase the risk of needing an operation to stop bleeding and should not be used after tonsillectomy. Though a small number of studies may potentially have been missed, the conclusions appear appropriate.
