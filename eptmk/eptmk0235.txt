Rehabilitation of ligamentous ankle injuries: a review of recent studies
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed treatments for ankle rehabilitation. The authors concluded that combinations of different exercises improve results, and that ankle disk training plus taping appeared to be the best method for improving range of motion. The evidence, which came from small studies of unknown quality that assessed different treatments, was limited and was insufficient to support the authors' conclusions.
