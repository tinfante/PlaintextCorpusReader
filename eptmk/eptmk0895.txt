The safety and efficacy of formoterol (Oxis) turbuhaler plus budesonide (Pulmicort) turbuhaler in mild to moderate asthma: a comparison with budesonide Turbuhaler alone and current non-corticosteroid therapy in Russia.
Current therapy in Russia for long-term management of asthma is mainly non-steroidal. This provided the opportunity to compare the efficacy and safety of formoterol (Oxis) Turbuhaler plus budesonide (Pulmicort) Turbuhaler with budesonide Turbuhaler alone in adults (n=338) with mild to moderate asthma who had little previous exposure to inhaled corticosteroids. The 12-week study followed a randomised, double-blind, parallel group design and included an open control group of patients who were treated with conventional non-corticosteroid therapy. Patients treated with formoterol plus budesonide benefited from a significantly greater improvement in their pulmonary function and asthma symptoms compared with budesonide alone (95% Cl of difference in mean morning peak expiratory flow [PEF] 8.7-36.3 l/min, p=0.0015). Non-corticosteroid treatment was significantly less effective than formoterol plus budesonide and budesonide alone (95% CIs of differences in mean morning PEF were 36.4-63.6 l/min and 14.1-41.1 l/min, respectively, both p=0.0001). Although the incidence and frequency of adverse events was not significantly different between the groups, formoterol plus budesonide and budesonide alone were better tolerated than non-corticosteroid treatment, and there were fewer incidences of asthma deterioration. Overall, formoterol Turbuhaler plus budesonide Turbuhaler was the safest and most effective treatment.
