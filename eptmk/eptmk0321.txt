An evaluation of the Respiratory One Method (ROM) in reducing emotional exhaustion among family physician residents.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate a particular burnout risk reduction method among family physicians within a family practice residency program and to contribute to the very limited research literature on family physician residents' stress reduction. The author used the Respiratory One Method (ROM) as a burnout risk reduction method. This study used a quasi-experimental design to compare participating physicians with a control group. To test the research hypothesis that ROM has an effect on emotional exhaustion (EE), the data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. The results revealed that the ROM treatment did have an effect on emotional exhaustion scores. Findings of this study are useful for burnout prevention and curriculum development among family physicians caring for patients in family practice programs.
