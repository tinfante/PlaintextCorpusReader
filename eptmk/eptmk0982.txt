Comparison of meclofenamate sodium with buffered aspirin and placebo for the relief of postoperative dental pain.
The analgesic effect of meclofenamate sodium at two dose levels (100 mg and 200 mg) was compared with the effects of buffered aspirin (600 mg) and placebo in a double-blind, randomized study of 105 dental outpatients with acute pain following third-molar extraction. Meclofenamate sodium at either dose level was significantly superior to both buffered aspirin and placebo, resulting in significantly greater relief of pain. All four treatments were well tolerated, and side effects were minimal. Meclofenamate sodium is a safe, highly effective analgesic for the relief of acute pain.
