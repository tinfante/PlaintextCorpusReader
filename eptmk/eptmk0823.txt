A comparative study of the effect of the Progestasert TM and Gravigard IUDs on dysmenorrhoea.
Data obtained from questionnaires on the occurrence of dysmenorrhoea in women using IUDs inserted randomly (146 of them Progestasert and 149 Copper 7) are analyzed. In both groups a reduction in the intensity of menstrual cramps was observed over 12 months of use. Although these reductions are significant in each group, they are slightly higher in Progestasert users. However, on comparing the reduction tendencies of both groups, the difference between them is not significant. No significant differences become apparent either when comparing premenstrual and intermenstrual camps. The usefulness of simple questionnaires directed at detecting the nature of pain in currently used family planning forms for IUD users is discussed.
