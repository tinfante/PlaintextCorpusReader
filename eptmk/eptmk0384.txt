Spinal and general anaesthesia in total hip replacement: frequency of deep vein thrombosis.
Subarachnoid block (SAB) or general anaesthesia (GA) was induced in 85 patients undergoing total hip replacement. The frequency of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), assessed by fibrinogen uptake studies and venography, was 29% in those patients receiving SAB and 54% in the GA group. Total blood loss (intra-operative and post-operative wound suction drainage) in SAB group was 66% and total transfusion volume 52% of that of GA group. No morbidity attributable to SAB or to the associated arterial hypotension was detected.
