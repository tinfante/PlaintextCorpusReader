Subglottic secretion drainage for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the use of subglottic secretion drainage in the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The authors concluded that, compared with no drainage, drainage reduces the incidence of pneumonia by half in mechanically ventilated patients. The authors' conclusions about the efficacy of subglottic secretion drainage appear to be supported by the evidence.
