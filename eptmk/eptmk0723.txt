Oral midazolam as premedication for the apprehensive child before dental treatment.
A double-blind study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of an oral dose of midazolam 7.5 mg as compared to placebo in a sample of 32 children who had refused dental care after the conventional psychological approach alone was used to reduce fear and apprehensive behavior. Parameters assessed before and 30 minutes after the oral administration of either midazolam or placebo were mental attitude, hypnotic activity, motor activity, quality of sedation and of dental treatment. A three-point scale was designed in each studied parameter and mean values +/- s.e.m. were compared before and after treatment by using Wilcoxon's rank test. It was shown that an oral dose of midazolam 7.5 mg significantly improved all parameters under evaluation (p < 0.01) as compared to placebo, effects which appeared thirty minutes after administration. It is concluded that oral midazolam provides a fast and adequate sedation in children refusing dental care. Thus, the drug is an alternative to other sedative or hypnotic drugs currently used in the premedication of the apprehensive child.
