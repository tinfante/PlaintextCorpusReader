Complementary and alternative therapies for the management of menopause-related symptoms: a systematic evidence review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed randomised evidence for the use of complementary and alternative therapies in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. The review included a wide range of interventions but concluded that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that any of the included therapies was effective. Given concerns about aspects of the review methods, it is not clear how reliable these conclusions are.
