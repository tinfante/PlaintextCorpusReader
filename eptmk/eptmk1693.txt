Usefulness of serum IgG4 in the diagnosis and follow-up of autoimmune pancreatitis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that serum immunoglobulin G4 serum levels were good markers for autoimmune pancreatitis and should be incorporated in its diagnostic workup. These conclusions should be interpreted with extreme caution given the possibility of missing studies, failure to assess study quality and heterogeneity between studies.
