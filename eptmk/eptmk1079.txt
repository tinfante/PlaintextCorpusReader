Osteoarthritis and the postmenopausal woman: epidemiological, magnetic resonance imaging, and radiological findings
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effect of oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT) on articular cartilage in postmenopausal women. The authors concluded that there was weak evidence to suggest that ERT may protect against large joint osteoarthritis. However, a negative effect was seen on cartilage volume in postmenopausal women. The review conclusions are unlikely to be robust given concerns about the review methodology and the poor quality of the studies.
