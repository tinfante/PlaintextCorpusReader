Phenelzine versus imipramine in the treatment of probable atypical depression: defining syndrome boundaries of selective MAOI responders.
Sixty patients with probable atypical depression--defined as meeting Research Diagnostic Criteria for depressive illness, having reactive mood, and having one of four associated symptoms (hyperphagia, hypersomnolence, leaden feeling, and sensitivity to rejection)--took part in a study contrasting phenelzine, imipramine, and placebo. Phenelzine was found to be superior to imipramine and placebo. These results were compared to results from a sample of 120 patients with identical characteristics, except that they had more than one associated atypical symptom (full atypical syndrome). The size of the drug effect was comparable in patients with full atypical and partial atypical syndromes.
