Prophylactic amiodarone for prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the effects of amiodarone in post-operative atrial fibrillation. It concluded that amiodarone prophylaxis is associated with a significant reduction in atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, as well as a reduction in peri-operative ventricular tachyarrhythmias and strokes and a short but significant reduction in hospital stay. The authors' conclusions reflect the evidence presented and are likely to be reliable.
