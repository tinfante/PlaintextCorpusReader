Reduction of dosing frequency of carbamazepine with a slow-release preparation.
The occurrence of side effects and epileptic seizures and the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine (CBZ) and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide were studied using a slow-release CBZ preparation, Neurotol slow, and a conventional CBZ preparation, Tegretol. The study was an open, randomized cross-over trial, with a 2 week study period for each preparation. Tegretol was given 3 times and Neurotol slow twice a day. The earlier CBZ dose was kept unchanged. The initial sample consisted of 24 adult epileptic patients receiving CBZ treatment of whom 20 patients were evaluable. The fluctuation in serum CBZ concentrations did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment periods, even though the interdose interval of Neurotol slow was 4 h longer than that of Tegretol. The switch-over from conventional CBZ to the slow-release formulation did not seem to alter the efficacy and side effects of CBZ. By using Neurotol slow instead of a conventional CBZ preparation, Tegretol, it is evidently possible to reduce the dosing frequency from 3 times a day to twice daily administrations.
