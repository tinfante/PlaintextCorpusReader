Prevention of deep-vein thrombosis after total hip and knee replacement. Low-molecular-weight heparin in combination with intermittent pneumatic compression.
After total hip (THR) or knee replacement (TKR), there is still an appreciable risk of developing deep-vein thrombosis despite prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). In a prospective, randomised study we examined the efficacy of LMWH in combination with intermittent pneumatic compression in patients undergoing primary unilateral THR or TKR. We administered 40 mg of enoxaparin daily to 131 patients combined with either the use of intermittent pneumatic compression or the wearing of graduated compression stockings. Compression ultrasonography showed no evidence of thrombosis after LMWH and intermittent pneumatic compression. In the group with LMWH and compression stockings the prevalence of thrombosis was 28.6% (40% after TKR, 14% after THR). This difference was significant (p < 0.0001). In the early post-operative phase after THR and TKR, combined prophylaxis with LMWH and intermittent pneumatic compression is more effective than LMWH used with graduated compression stockings.
