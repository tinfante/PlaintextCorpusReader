Computed tomography diagnosis of ischemia and complete obstruction in small bowel obstruction: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review attempted to assess the role of computed tomography (CT) in the diagnostic workup of patients with small bowel obstruction. It concluded that CT is highly accurate for the diagnosis of ischaemia. Poor definition of inclusion criteria, a limited search strategy, poor reporting of review methodology or details of included studies, and the inappropriate use of aggregate measures of diagnostic accuracy severely limit the reliability of the findings.
