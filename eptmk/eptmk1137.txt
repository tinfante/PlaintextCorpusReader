Effect of high-flux hemodialysis on cardiac structure and function among patients with end-stage renal failure.
The effect of high flux hemodialysis on left ventricular function in ESRD patients was evaluated in a double blind, single cross-over, study comparing conventional to high flux hemodialysis. The subjects were 21 stable chronic hemodialysis patients. Ten were randomly allocated to the conventional-high flux sequence and 11 to the reverse sequence. The conventional membrane was the CD 3,500 or 4,000; the high flux membrane was the Duoflux (Althin Medical Inc., Miami Lakes, Fla.). Both were cellulose acetate and both were sterilized with ethylene oxide. The dialysate bicarbonate and sodium were held constant for the study. The ultrafiltration rates were 3.5-5.0 ml/h/mm Hg transmembrane pressure for the conventional and 15 ml/h/mm for the high flux membrane. The beta-2-microglobulin sieving coefficient was 0 for conventional and 0.27 for the high-flux membrane. The modest improvements in estimates of systolic function suggest a cardiac advantage in high-flux dialysis, the clinical impact of which requires further study.
