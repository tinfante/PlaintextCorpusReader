A randomized trial of intraoperative autotransfusion during aortic surgery.
PURPOSE: The net benefit of routine intraoperative autotransfusion (IAT) in patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic surgery was studied. METHODS: One hundred patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (n = 50) or aortofemoral bypass (AFB) for occlusive disease (n = 50) were randomized to IAT and control groups. This experience accounted for 58% of patients undergoing aortic surgery during the 16-month study period. RESULTS: IAT and control groups were balanced for preoperative demographics, disease (50:50 split of AFB:AAA in each group), and risk factors. There were no significant differences between patients randomized to IAT and control patients in estimated blood loss (EBL), allogeneic blood transfusion (units administered intraoperatively, postoperatively, and total), proportion of patients not receiving allogeneic blood (34% of patients randomized to IAT and 28% of control patients), postoperative hemoglobin/hematocrit levels, and complications. IAT did not reduce allogeneic blood transfusion among all patients undergoing aortic surgery nor in any subgroups that might be more likely to benefit, such as those undergoing AAA repair, those with 1000 mL or more EBL, and those receiving larger volumes of IAT-processed blood. CONCLUSION: We could find no net benefit of IAT in patients undergoing elective, infrarenal aortic surgery.
