Efficacy of selected treatments of HIV wasting: a systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the efficacy of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), testosterone and anabolic steroids in the treatment of HIV wasting. The authors concluded that there were no significant differences between the treatments in their efficacy for increasing lean body mass, but an approved dose of rhGH may be advantageous in terms of functional capacity and quality of life. Given the methodology of the review, the reliability of the results and conclusions is uncertain.
