Treatment of major affective disorder with fluvoxamine.
A placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 63 inpatients with major affective disorder was performed to compare the safety and efficacy of fluvoxamine and imipramine. Results indicate that fluvoxamine and imipramine are superior to placebo and demonstrate a trend toward superiority of fluvoxamine over imipramine. Fluvoxamine was generally well tolerated in most patients.
