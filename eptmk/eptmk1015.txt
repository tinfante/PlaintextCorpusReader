Postabortion insertion of the Nova T and MLCu250: preliminary results of a comparative study.
This 4-year prospective randomized study is designed to compare the effectiveness and complication rates of the Nova T and MLCu250 inserted immediately postabortion. At the cut-off date (30 November 1983), all patients in the first cohort of 400 women had completed at least 12 months of use. At this stage of the trial, no significant differences had emerged between the two devices in any of the standard termination categories.
