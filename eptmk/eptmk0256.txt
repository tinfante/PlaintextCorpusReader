Hay fever and a single intramuscular injection of corticosteroid: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review investigated the efficacy and side-effects of a single intramuscular injection of systemic corticosteroid for the treatment of hay fever in adults. The authors concluded that systemic corticosteroid therapy is efficient and that there is no evidence of serious side-effects. The reliability of the conclusions are doubtful given the limitations in the search, quality assessment and reporting of the review process.
