Domperidone drops in the symptomatic treatment of chronic paediatric vomiting and regurgitation. A comparison with metoclopramide.
Forty-seven infants and children suffering from chronic vomiting or regurgitation, participated in a two-week double-blind trial comparing 1% drops of domperidone, 1% metoclopramide drops or placebo. The dose was 0.3 mg/kg given t.d.s. before meals. Both active medicaments were significantly more effective than placebo in controlling the symptoms and domperidone was also significantly superior to metoclopramide. It is concluded, in view of the good safety margin with domperidone, that this drug could become the treatment of choice in such cases.
