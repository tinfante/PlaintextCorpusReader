Effect of smoke-free home and workplace policies on second-hand smoke exposure levels in children: an evidence summary
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that any reductions in second-hand smoke exposure levels in public settings would ultimately lead to improvements in the general health of children in private settings but smoke-free home policies would have additional benefits. These conclusions should be interpreted with caution given the limited methodological rigour of included studies.
