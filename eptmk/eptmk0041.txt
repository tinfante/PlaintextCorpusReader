Analgesic effects of oral propiram fumarate, codeine sulfate and placebo in postoperative pain.
Our purpose was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of single oral doses of propiram fumarate 50 mg, codeine sulfate 60 mg and placebo in the relief of moderate to severe postoperative pain. One hundred and twenty patients completed a randomized, double-blind, single-dose, stratified, parallel-groups trial and were observed for either 4 or 6 hours. Based upon each of the summary efficacy measures--SPID, % SPID and TOTAL--propiram and codeine were approximately equally effective and both were statistically superior to placebo. Propiram was significantly more effective than codeine at hour 5 for Pain Intensity Difference. Two adverse effects were attributed to propiram. Propiram fumarate 50 mg is an effective oral analgesic similar to codeine sulfate 60 mg, with the possibility of a longer duration of action.
