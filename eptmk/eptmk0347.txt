Lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination compared with the monocomponents in elderly hypertensive patients.
The fixed combination of lisinopril 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (L/HCTZ) was compared with each of the monocomponents in a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study involving elderly patients with mild to severe hypertension. At the end of the trial, a total of 278 patients had completed 8 weeks of treatment. SBP reduction from baseline in the L/HCTZ group was significantly greater, sitting and standing, compared with both the monotherapy groups. Sitting DBP reduction from baseline in the L/HCTZ group was significantly greater than in the hydrochlorothiazide group. Uric acid levels were raised significantly more in the L/HCTZ group compared with the lisinopril group, and the fall in potassium levels were significantly smaller in the L/HCTZ group compared with the hydrochlorothiazide group. Safety and tolerability were equivalent for the three groups.
