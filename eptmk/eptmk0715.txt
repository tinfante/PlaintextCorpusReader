Laparoscopic versus conventional appendectomy: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that laparoscopic appendectomy was associated with significant benefits compared with open appendectomy in patients with acute appendicitis and that it was a safe and effective treatment alternative to open appendectomy. However, the unexplained variation across the results of the trials means that the reliability of the authors' conclusions is unclear.
