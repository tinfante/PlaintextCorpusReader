Surgery for massive pulmonary embolism.
Pulmonary embolectomies were performed in 30 patients from January 1973 until December 1991 in the University Hospital of Leuven. There was an 80% hospital survival. The late follow-up showed no recurrent pulmonary emboli. The preoperative haemodynamic status was the most important predictor for survival. Patients, under cardiopulmonary resuscitation or in profound cardiogenic shock before surgery, had a survival of only 50% while all other patients survived. Angiography, performed in only 23% of the cases, remained the most important diagnostic tool until the advent of transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography. Thrombolysis is an acceptable alternative in the stable patient, but pulmonary embolectomy is life-saving in the haemodynamically unstable patient and when thrombolysis is contraindicated.
