Autologous blood transfusion in total knee replacement surgery.
We compared allogeneic blood usage for two groups of patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery (TKR). Patients were randomized to receive either their post-operative wound drainage as an autotransfusion (n=115) after processing or to have this wound drainage discarded (n=116). Allogeneic blood was transfused in patients of either group whose haemoglobin fell below 9 g dl(-1). Only 7% of patients in the autotransfusion group required an allogeneic transfusion compared with 28% in the control group (P<0.001). There was no hospital mortality and only 3% mortality from all causes at the study completion, which spanned 6 months to 3 yr. There was a higher incidence of infection requiring intervention in the allogeneic group (P<0.036). Total patient costs were Pound Sterling 113 greater in the autotransfusion group. We conclude that in this type of surgery post-operative cell salvage is a safe and effective method for reducing allogeneic blood use.
