Double balloon enteroscopy and capsule endoscopy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that capsule endoscopy (CE) and double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) had similar diagnostic yields for the localisation of bleeding in patients with occult gastrointestinal bleeding, and the yield of DBE was increased when used after a positive CE. These conclusions reflect the data presented, but should be interpreted cautiously due to potential methodological limitations in the review process.
