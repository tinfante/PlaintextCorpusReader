Topical treatments for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis: systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and effectiveness
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effectiveness of topical treatments for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. The authors concluded that topical mast cell stabilisers and topical antihistamines are superior to placebo, but there is insufficient evidence for the superiority of one type of medication. The authors' conclusions appear to be supported by the evidence presented, but many studies were short term and there was evidence of publication bias.
