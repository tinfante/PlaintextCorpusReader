Effects of stem cell therapy on left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that evidence suggested stem cell therapy improved heart left ventricular contractibility, but had no effect on left ventricular remodelling in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Given concerns over the possibility of missed studies, the unclear quality of included data and the methods of analysis, the authors' conclusions should be treated with caution.
