Analgesic efficacy of meclofenamate sodium in episiotomy pain.
Meclofenamate sodium was compared, double-blind, with codeine and placebo for the treatment of acute episiotomy pain. One hundred sixty-eight women with moderate or severe episiotomy pain after normal delivery were assigned randomly to one of four treatment groups: one received meclofenamate sodium 200 mg at dose 1 and 100 mg at doses 2 and 3; one received meclofenamate sodium 100 mg at dose 1 and 50 mg at doses 2 and 3; one received codeine 60 mg at all three doses; and one received placebo at all three doses. Efficacy measurements were evaluated periodically for 6 hours after medication. After the first administration, both doses of meclofenamate sodium were significantly superior to placebo and to codeine from 2-6 hours in pain intensity difference and pain relief. For second and third doses, data were available for too few patients to allow valid analysis and interpretation. Adverse effects occurred in 4 patients in each meclofenamate sodium group, and in 8 in the codeine group and in 6 in the placebo group. The study indicates that single 100- and 200-mg doses of meclofenamate sodium are as safe as, and significantly more effective than, codeine 60 mg or placebo for episiotomy pain.
