Supplemental calcium in the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that supplemental calcium was effective for prevention of adenoma recurrence in patients with a history of adenomas. There was no similar effect in patients at higher and lower risks. These conclusions reflected the evidence presented, but should be interpreted cautiously in view of the limited quality of some of the included studies.
