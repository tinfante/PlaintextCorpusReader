How effective were lifestyle interventions in real-world settings that were modeled on the Diabetes Prevention Program?
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that lifestyle interventions modelled on the US Diabetes Prevention Program produced a clinically significant weight loss in adults at high risk of diabetes. Using lay personnel could reduce costs without sacrificing effectiveness. The review process was effective, but the studies were of limited quality and the authors' conclusions should be treated with caution.
