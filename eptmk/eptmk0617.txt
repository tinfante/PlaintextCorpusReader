[Acamprosate--a stabilizing factor in long-term withdrawal of alcoholic patients]
In a one-year double-blind-treatment study with acamprosat (six months with and six months without substance) the efficiency of this new medicament could be proved. The number of relapses in the treatment group was significantly lower during the first 30 days with a trend to further 150 days. The substance caused very few side effects.
