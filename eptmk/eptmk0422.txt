Efficacy of statins for primary prevention in people at low cardiovascular risk: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The review concluded that both low- and high-potency statins were efficacious in preventing death and cardiovascular-related morbidity in people at low risk of cardiovascular events, although the number needed to treat to prevent one adverse outcome was relatively high for any statin. The authors' conclusions reflect the evidence available and appear likely to be reliable.
