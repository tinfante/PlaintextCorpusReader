Pomeroy tubal ligation by laparoscopy and minilaparotomy.
Pomeroy tubal ligation is a widely-used method for surgical female sterilization. A laparoscopic technique of Pomeroy tubal ligation using endoloop sutures is compared with the conventional technique of Pomeroy tubal ligation by minilaparotomy. Forty-four women requiring sterilization were randomly selected for either laparoscopy (n = 24) or minilaparotomy (n = 20). Mean operative time in the laparoscopy group (18.90 +/- 5.56 with a range of 12-35 minutes) was not significantly different from that in the minilaparotomy (23.12 +/- 8.24 with a range of 15-45 minutes) group. In all women, tubal specimens confirmed tubal histology. Both laparoscopy and minilaparotomy procedures may be performed for Pomeroy tubal ligation with minor morbidity. In clinics with appropriate conditions, Pomeroy tubal ligation by laparoscopy may be preferable to minilaparotomy.
