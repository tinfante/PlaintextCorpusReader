[Preliminary results of a randomized trial comparing the efficacy of standard heparin with that of fragmine, a low molecular weight heparin, in the prevention of postoperative thrombosis in cancer surgery].
Low molecular weight heparins have stimulated much interest because of their supposedly more selective action on Xa factor. A randomized study in 50 patients compared efficacy of low doses of a standard heparin, calciparin (5,000 IU/8 h) with that of a low molecular weight heparin, fragmine (Kabi 2165) (5,000 anti-Xa U/24 h), in the prophylaxis of postoperative thrombosis after oncologic surgery. Three of 25 patients receiving calciparin developed pulmonary embolism, as against one of 25 treated with fragmine who developed a periphlebitis. Hemorrhagic complications were comparable in the two groups. Anti-Xa activity was significantly higher in the fragmine group, whereas platelet counts, cephalin times with activator and anti-IIa activity were similar. These findings indicate equal efficacy of fragmine and calciparin in the prophylaxis of post-oncology surgery venous thrombosis.
