Transient hyperinsulinism in an asphyxiated newborn infant with hypoglycemia.
We describe a case of transient hyperinsulinism in an asphyxiated newborn infant with hypoglycemia. Although hypoglycemia in birth asphyxiated infants is generally attributed to depletion of glycogen stores, we observed severe hyperinsulinism associated with the hypoglycemia. The hypoglycemia was refractory to high glucose delivery rates (25 mg/kg/min), but responded to a combination of octreotide and diazoxide. At 3 weeks of age, the medications were discontinued and infant was normoglycemic on glucose infusion rates of 5-8 mg/kg/min. Subsequent insulin studies were within normal limits. Transient hyperinsulinism should be considered in asphyxiated infants with protracted hypoglycemia and medications designed to suppress insulin secretion may be useful in refractory cases.
