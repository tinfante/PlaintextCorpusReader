A multicenter Italian randomised study on early treatment of Parkinson disease: comparison of L-dopa, l-deprenyl and dopaminoagonists. Study design and short term results. The Italian Parkinson Study Group.
On the long term Parkinson Disease (PD) treatment is often complicated by the occurrence of motor fluctuations. To find out whether early treatment of PD with levodopa, dopaminoagonists or l-deprenyl is associated with any difference in motor fluctuations occurrence, the Italian Parkinson Study Group initiated a multicenter, randomized study. Since November 1988, 475 patients requiring effective treatment for idiopathic PD have been randomized to receive levodopa, dopamine agonists or deprenyl. After 2 months of therapy, all patients evaluated with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale showed a significant amelioration. Daily living activities were more impaired in patients treated with deprenyl. Study design is presented and first results are discussed.
