Effect of rosuvastatin on C-reactive protein and renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease.
The purpose of this 20-week, open-label, randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of rosuvastatin on fasting serum lipids and lipoproteins, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in 91 patients with chronic kidney disease. Patients were randomized to rosuvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 48) or to no lipid-lowering treatment (n = 43) for 20 weeks. In contrast to patients not receiving rosuvastatin, patients receiving rosuvastatin tended to derive more favorable improvements from baseline values in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-43%, p <0.001, vs 7%, p = NS; p <0.001 for change with rosuvastatin treatment vs change with no antilipemic treatment), hs-CRP (-47%, p <0.001, vs 7%, p = NS; p <0.001 for change with rosuvastatin treatment vs change with no antilipemic treatment), and GFR (11%, p <0.05, vs 4%, p = NS; p = NS for change with rosuvastatin treatment vs change with no antilipemic treatment).
