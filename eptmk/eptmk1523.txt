Optimal duration of combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for patients with moderate and severe depression: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy was more effective than pharmacotherapy alone in attaining remission and preventing relapse in patients with major depressive disorder. Given the lack of clarity on the review processes and the variety between the included trials, these conclusions should be regarded as informative rather than definitive.
