Combination therapy with methotrexate and chloroquine in rheumatoid arthritis. A multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial.
To compare the efficacy of the combination therapy Methotrexate (MTX) and Chloroquine (CHLO) with MTX and Placebo (PLA) in the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis. A total of 82 patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, received orally either MTX 7.5 mg/week and CHLO 250 mg/day or MTX 7.5 mg/week and PLA 1 tablet/day. Adverse effects (AE) were monitored monthly and disease activity was assessed at 0, 2, 4 and 6 months. Sixty-eight patients completed the study. All outcome measures improved significantly in both treatment groups. Patients receiving MTX/CHLO ended the study with a significantly lower joint count, greater grip strength and better functional ability the patients in the MTX/PLA group, respectively; 4.5 vs 7.5 (P < 0.05), 113.3 vs 89.1 (P < 0.05) and 0.636 vs 0.811 (P < 0.05). Mild AE were more frequently observed in the MTX/CHLO, 17 events in 15 patients, compared to 9 events in 8 patients in the MTX/PLA group (NS). These data indicate that MTX/CHLO is slightly more efficacious and toxic than is MTX/PLA in the treatment of RA.
