A double-blind randomized controlled trial on the use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing elective caesarean section.
In a double-blind randomized controlled study 232 patients undergoing elective lower segment caesarean section were randomly allocated to receive a pre-operative prophylactic dose of a combination of crystalline penicillin and chloramphenicol or a placebo. The two groups were comparable in terms of patient characteristics and operation variables. The group receiving antibiotics had significantly fewer febrile and infectious morbid events and thus spent fewer days in hospital than the group receiving the placebo.
