Thrombophilic abnormalities, oral contraceptives, and risk of cerebral vein thrombosis: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the risk of cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT) associated with oral contraceptive (OC) use. The authors concluded that OC users are at increased risk of CVT, particularly those with a pre-existing prothrombotic condition. However, these findings were based on a diverse group of studies with inherent biases, suggesting that the authors' findings should be interpreted with caution.
