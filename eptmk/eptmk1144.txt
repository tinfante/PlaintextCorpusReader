Resilience among black urban youth. Prevalence, intervention effects, and mechanisms of influence.
Prospective and longitudinal data were used to investigate scholastic and social resilience in 1,170 low-income black 12-year-olds. One-fifth were found to be scholastically resilient, almost two-fifths socially resilient, and one-quarter were both. Participation in extended childhood intervention was significantly associated with both resilience outcomes, while academic achievement in third-grade and parent expectations of educational attainment consistently predicted resilience and were major mediators of the effects of intervention and of risk status.
