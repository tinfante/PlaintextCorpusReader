Itraconazole versus ketaconazole in the treatment of oral and oesophageal candidosis in patients infected with HIV.
To determine the efficacy and toxicity of two systemically active antifungal agents in the treatment of buccal and oesophageal candidiasis 111 HIV-infected patients with microscopically-confirmed candidiasis were randomized to receive either 200 mg itraconazole once a day or 200 mg ketoconazole twice a day for 28 days in a double blind study. After 1 week of treatment, 75 and 82% of the patients on itraconazole and ketoconazole, respectively, had responded clinically. After 4 weeks of treatment, this had risen to 93% in each group. One patient discontinued itraconozole because of toxicity (rash), five patients discontinued ketaconazole (two nausea, two hepatotoxicity and one rash). Despite successful clinical and mycological clearance, 80% patients had a further episode of candidosis within the next 3 months.
