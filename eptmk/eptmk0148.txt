A differential diagnostic approach to the symptomatology of acute dental pain.
Seventy-four patients with acute pulpitis, apical periodontitis, marginal periodontitis, or pulpoperiodontitis were examined. A series of symptoms and signs was registered. Diagnostic specificities and sensitivities were calculated, and thirteen variables were subjected to discriminant analysis and log-linear multiway contingency table analysis. Pulpoperiodonitis was found inseparable from pulpitis on the basis of the registered symptoms and signs. Several symptoms and signs previously believed to have differential diagnostic power were found insignificant. The following combination of symptoms and signs yielded a correct diagnosis in 82.1% of the cases: constant pain, tenderness to temperature changes, "the tooth feels extruded," impaired mouth opening, tenderness to palpation in apical area, and mobility.
