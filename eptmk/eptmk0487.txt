Mechanical bowel preparation for elective colorectal surgery: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the role of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The authors concluded that there was no evidence to support the use of MBP in these patients, and that MBP may actually be harmful. The potential for selection bias and the generally poor quality of the included studies mean that the conclusions should be treated with caution.
