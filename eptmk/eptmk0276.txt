Auranofin improves outcome in early rheumatoid arthritis. Results from a 2-year, double blind placebo controlled study.
The effect of early initiation of auranofin (AF) therapy on outcome measures was studied in a controlled 24-month double blind trial in 138 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using an intent to treat approach. Patients were randomized to AF or placebo but in case of insufficient effect or intolerable adverse events, they switched to open disease modifying antirheumatic drug therapy. Patients who started AF fared significantly better in improved joint swelling. Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire index, Keitel functional test, and mental depression, and furthermore, radiologic progression was significantly retarded. Our results support a disease modifying beneficial effect of AF in early active RA.se
