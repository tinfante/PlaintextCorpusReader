Analysis of postdischarge change in a dual diagnosis population.
Many individuals with serious mental illnesses have co-occurring drug and alcohol problems. The research reported in this article examined an integrated inpatient mental illness-chemical dependency program and compared it with standard inpatient psychiatric treatment for two groups: those demonstrating high change from baseline to two-months postdischarge and those with negative or no change. Univariate analyses revealed significant differences in the change groups on baseline personal-clinical characteristics and on aspects of their social and physical environments. The results have implications for improving mental health practice by better predicting patients who will optimally benefit from inpatient treatment.
