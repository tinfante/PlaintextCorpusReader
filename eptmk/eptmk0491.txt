Meta-analysis: accuracy of rapid tests for malaria in travelers returning from endemic areas
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated rapid diagnostic tests for ruling out malaria in non-immune travellers. The authors concluded that histidine-rich protein-2-based tests are a useful adjunct to microscopy in excluding Plasmodium falciparum infection in centres without major expertise in tropical medicine, but more research is required for other species. The review was generally well conducted and the conclusions should be reliable.
