Bibliotherapy within a correctional setting.
Evaluated the psychotherapeutic adjunct of bibliotherapy in a maximum security correctional setting with 54 volunteers from a general and segregation population. Results indicated no differences between the treatment methods, but significant increases in self-concept and internal locus of control with an interaction on the dependent measure of Chance locus of control. There were no significant effects on the dependent variables as a result of the level of participation of the volunteers. It was concluded that bibliotherapy may have a facilitative effect on self-concept and internal locus of control, but cannot be differentiated from the effects of therapist intervention.
