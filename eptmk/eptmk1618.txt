Autotransfusion of mediastinal blood in cardiac surgery.
A series of 135 adults undergoing cardiac surgery was randomized to an autotransfusion group (n = 67) or a control group (n = 68). In the autotransfusion group mediastinal blood was collected and reinfused during the first 6 postoperative hours. Blood from the reservoir was taken for bacteriologic culture at the end of that time. The postoperative blood was comparable in the two groups. The average requirement of bank blood was 2.7 units in the autotransfusion group and 3.3 units in the controls (p less than 0.05). The average volume of autotransfusion blood was 336 ml. There were no clinical infections in the autotransfusion group, although 19% of the cultures were positive, and no apparent alteration of the coagulation mechanisms arose from infusion of autologous blood. No clinically significant intergroup differences were found in hematologic, renal or hepatic parameters, neurologic function or use of antibiotics.
