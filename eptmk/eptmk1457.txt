Long-term use of different doses of low-molecular-weight heparin versus vitamin K antagonists in the treatment of venous thromboembolism
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that full-dose low molecular weight heparin treatment for three to six months was as safe as intermediate and prophylactic doses for long-term treatment of deep vein thrombosis. Evidence was based on indirect comparisons, which combined with an inadequate study quality assessment and small numbers of events for some analyses means that the conclusions may not be reliable.
