Efficacy and safety of antidepressants for children and adolescents
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the quality and reporting of trials of newer antidepressant drugs for children. The new drugs were associated with a small benefit, which may have been exaggerated, and some serious adverse effects, which may have been downplayed. Many details of the methods used in the review were not reported, but the conclusions seem valid.
