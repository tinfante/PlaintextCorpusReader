Effectiveness of designated driver programs for reducing alcohol-impaired driving: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effectiveness of designated driver programmes on alcohol-impaired driving and alcohol-related crashes. The authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of population-based campaigns or incentive programmes based in drinking establishments. Overall, this was a well-conducted review and the authors' conclusions reflect the limited evidence.
