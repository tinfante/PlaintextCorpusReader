Pararenal aortic aneurysm repair using fenestrated endografts
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that fenestrated endovascular aortic aneurysm repair appeared to be feasible, safe and effective, in relatively high-risk patients, with pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms, at up to two years after surgery. Given the high likelihood of bias in the included studies and the absence of any comparator therapies, the reliability of the authors' conclusions is uncertain.
