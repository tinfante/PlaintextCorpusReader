Tranexamic acid reduces allogeneic red cell transfusions in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty: results of a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that the use of tranexamic acid was effective in reducing the requirements of allogeneic blood transfusion for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. These conclusions needed to be interpreted in light of the fact that the included studies differed on key characteristics and other relevant studies might have been missed.
