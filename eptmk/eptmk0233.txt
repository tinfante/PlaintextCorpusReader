Rehabilitation for Parkinson's disease: a systematic review of available evidence
CRD SUMMARY: The review evaluated the effectiveness of non-pharmacological rehabilitation interventions for people with Parkinson's disease. The authors concluded that these interventions can affect patients' lives for the better in a variety of ways. However, publication bias cannot be ruled out, the clinical importance of the reported improvements is unclear, and more robust research is needed. Overall, the conclusions appear reliable.
