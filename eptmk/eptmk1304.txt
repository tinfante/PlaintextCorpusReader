The short-time effect of latanoprost on the intraocular pressure in normal pressure glaucoma.
Latanoprost, a prostaglandin analogue, was given topically to 20 patients with normal pressure glaucoma in a double masked randomized study. Either latanoprost 0.006% or placebo (vehicle) was administered twice a day for 14 days. Latanoprost caused a statistically significant (p < 0.001) reduction in intraocular pressure from a diurnal baseline level of 16.8 to 14.3 mmHg, as measured on day 14. Latanoprost was well tolerated.
