A meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of statins in children with familial hypercholesterolemia.
This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of statins on the lipid profile in pediatric and adolescent patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Randomized, double-blind, controlled trials comparing statins with placebo were identified through electronic and manual search; percent reductions from baseline were calculated for various lipid parameters. Standardized mean differences (effect size) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each study and pooled effect size was calculated. A total of 6 studies were included in the meta-analysis. As compared to placebo, statins caused a significant decrease in total cholesterol (TC) [-3.11% (95% CI -3.46 to -2.99)], low-density lipoprotein (LDL) [-4.01% (95% CI -4.27 to -3.81)], triglyceride (TG) [-1.41 (95% CI -1.66 to -1.26)] and a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) [1.12 (95% CI 0.73 1.13)]. In conclusion, statins were shown to have good efficacy for the treatment of FH in children.
