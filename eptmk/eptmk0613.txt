Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial.
A double-blind controlled study of the effects of buspirone on alcohol dependence and associated symptoms in ambulatory alcoholics showed a marked improvement in both treatment and control groups. However, significant differences in favor of the medication were observed in several psychopathological measures, but not in measures of alcohol consumption. Contrary to a majority of prior controlled trials of buspirone in alcoholics, subjects were not selected on the basis of comorbid generalized anxiety; rather, the study tested the hypothesis of a direct effect on craving and consumption, independent from an anxiolytic effect. This hypothesis was not confirmed.
