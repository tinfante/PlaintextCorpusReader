Non-narcotic adjuvants may improve the duration and quality of analgesia after knee arthroscopy: a brief review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed whether intra-articular non-narcotic adjuvants improved the duration of analgesia after arthroscopic knee surgery. The authors concluded that intra-articular clonidine and ketorolac may reduce post-operative pain. Overall, the authors' conclusions are consistent with the evidence reviewed, but the magnitude of any treatment effect is unclear given the lack of detail reported in the results.
