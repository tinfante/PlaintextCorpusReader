Comparison of the effects of dietary plant sterol and stanol esters on lipid metabolism.
BACKGROUND AND AIM: To compare the cholesterol-lowering efficacy and other metabolic effects of plant sterol and stanol esters, both of which are commonly used in the dietary management of hypercholesterolaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: The cholesterol-lowering efficacy of equivalent intakes of sterol and stanol esters and of different intakes of stanol esters were compared at 1 and 2 months, both in normal subjects and treated patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Systemic effects were assessed by measuring serum levels of plant sterols and of lathosterol and 7alpha-hydroxy-cholestenone, indices of sterol absorption and of cholesterol and bile acid synthesis respectively. There were no significant differences during the study between 1.6g daily of sterol and stanol esters in reducing total cholesterol (by 3-7%) or low density lipoprotein cholesterol (by 4-8%), nor between 1.6 and 2.6 g daily of stanol. However, the cholesterol-lowering effect of plant sterol esters was attenuated between 1 and 2 months. This was accompanied by increased serum plant sterols and decreased levels of 7alpha-hydroxy-cholestenone, especially in statin-treated hypercholesterolaemic patients not taking bile acid sequestrants. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that absorption of dietary plant sterols suppressed bile acid synthesis, thereby diminishing their cholesterol-lowering efficacy. In contrast, plant stanols reduced plant sterol absorption and maintained their cholesterol-lowering efficacy.
