Continuous passive motion after total knee arthroplasty.
Sixty-two patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty were studied prospectively. There were 42 patients in whom continuous passive motion (CPM) was used after surgery and 20 controls. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, diagnosis, sex, weight, and preoperative deformity and motion. The mean length of time required for CPM patients to achieve 90 degrees of flexion (9.1 days) was shorter than that for the control group (13.8 days). At the time of discharge from the hospital, however, there was no significant difference between the groups in amount of either flexion or extension. All patients had venograms performed after arthroplasty; the incidence of positive studies indicating thrombophlebitis was 45% in CPM patients and 75% in controls. These data demonstrate that CPM after knee arthroplasty enables patients to recover motion more quickly and affords some protection against deep vein thrombosis.
