Disease-specific self-management programs in patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a comprehensive and critical evaluation
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the benefits of disease-specific self-management programmes on health status and health resources in patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The authors concluded that disease-specific self-management can improve patients' health status and reduce physician visits and hospital use. Given that the conduct and reporting of the review had some flaws, the conclusions should be interpreted with caution.
