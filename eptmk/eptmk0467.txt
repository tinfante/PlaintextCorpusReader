Diagnostic value of C reactive protein in infections of the lower respiratory tract: systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that testing for C reactive protein was neither sufficiently sensitive to rule out nor specific to rule in both an infiltrate on chest radiograph and bacterial aetiology of lower respiratory tract infection. The authors highlighted the poor methodological quality of the few available studies in this area. The authors' conclusions are supported by the evidence presented.
