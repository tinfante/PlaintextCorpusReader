A double-blind clinical study with benzydamine 3% cream on soft tissue injuries in an occupational health centre.
A double-blind, controlled clinical study with benzydamine hydrochloride 3% cream was conducted in an Occupational Health Centre on fifty patients with soft tissue injuries (two mild, ten moderate and thirteen severe cases in the placebo group and one mild, thirteen moderate and twelve severe cases in the active group). The trial demonstrated the significant therapeutic superiority of 3% benzydamine cream over inactive placebo in all six qualitative parameters for traumatic inflammatory changes at the end of a six-day assessment and a marked improvement of symptoms event two days after the onset of therapy. In addition, tbe incidental use of ultrasound therapy together with the standard treatment revealed the value of the active drug as an effective couplant. Neither group suffered any side-effects. Although the size of population studied was small, it was apparent that active treatment with benzydamine was a distinct aid to healing of soft tissue injuries and this should be confirmed with further large-scale clinical trials.
