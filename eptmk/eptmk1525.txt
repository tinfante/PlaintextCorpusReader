Ephedrine versus phenylephrine for the management of hypotension during spinal anesthesia for cesarean section: an updated meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that use of ephedrine and phenylephrine were equally effective for preventing maternal hypotension during caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. Phenylephrine was superior to ephedrine for treating hypotension in women giving birth, shown by higher umbilical blood pH values. Given the limited number of included women and trials for most outcomes, these conclusions should be treated with caution.
