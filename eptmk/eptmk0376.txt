Re-occurrence of HIV-1 drug mutations after treatment re-initiation following interruption in patients with multiple treatment failure.
Antiretroviral treatment interruption in 20 extensively pre-treated HIV-1 patients with treatment failure led to genotype viral reversion of at least one class of drug-mutation resistance in half of the patients. The only predictive factor of reversion was found to be the duration of interruption. The outgrowth of residual wild-type virus seems not to be a true genetic reversion because drug mutations are detected rapidly at salvage therapy re-initiation.
