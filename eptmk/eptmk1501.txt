Impact of implantable defibrillators and resynchronization therapy on outcome in patients with left ventricular dysfunction: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that both cardiac resynchronisation therapy and implantable cardioverter defibrillator improve outcomes for selected patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction; combination of the two may provide further benefit. The review was well-conducted in many respects but, given the lack of a systematic validity assessment, poor reporting of study details and limitations of the primary studies, these conclusions may need to be viewed with some caution.
