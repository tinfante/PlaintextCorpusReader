Postoperative symptoms following LLETZ or radical cervical diathermy with fulgaration: a randomized double-blinded prospective study.
Fifty-five patients were randomized in a double-blinded manner to large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) (29 patients) or radical cervical diathermy with fulgaration (RCDF) (26 patients) for treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Patients completed a 2-month diary of symptoms and completed a 10-week postoperative questionnaire. White vaginal discharge lasted 7.3 (4.6) days (SD) for RCDF compared to 3.4 (1.6) days (SD) for LLETZ. There was no significant difference in any other symptoms on analysis This appears to be the first report clearly assessing the length and severity of postoperative symptoms following LLETZ or RCDF. There is no reason on length and severity of postoperative symptoms to choose 1 of these 2 treatment methods over the other.
