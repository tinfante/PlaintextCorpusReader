Mazindol treatment for cocaine dependence.
This double-blind placebo-controlled treatment study tested the efficacy of mazindol in currently cocaine-dependent out-patients. Forty-three patients were randomized to mazindol (2 mg QD) vs. placebo treatment for 6 weeks. All patients received weekly group counseling. Patients improved with respect to objective (urine toxicology) and subjective (self-report of times used, dollars spent, craving, etc.) measures. There was no response difference between patients treated with mazindol and those who received placebo.
