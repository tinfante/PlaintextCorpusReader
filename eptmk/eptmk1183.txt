The effects of an advanced practice nurse led telephone intervention on outcomes of patients with heart failure.
This study sought to determine the effect of an advanced-practice-nurse (APN)-led telephone intervention on hospital readmissions, quality of life, and self-care behaviors (SCBs) of patients with heart failure (HF). Twenty participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group that received the APN-led telephone intervention (ALTI) or a control group that received usual care in this pretest-posttest experimental study. The results of this study support the idea that an ALTI positively impacts outcomes of patient with HF, particularly by improving SCBs and decreasing hospital readmissions. An ALTI warrants consideration to improve outcomes of patients with HF.
