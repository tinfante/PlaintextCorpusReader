Postoperative collection and reinfusion of autologous blood in total knee arthroplasty.
A series of 40 patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty were entered into a randomised controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of postoperative autologous blood salvage and reinfusion. The mean volume of autologous blood reinfused was 520 ml per patient (51% of the mean total drainage). Homologous blood transfusion was required in only 35% of patients in the study group compared with 95% of patients in the control group (P less than 0.001). The mean volume of homologous blood transfused was 0.9 units per patient in the study group compared with 2.5 units in the control group (P less than 0.001), a saving of 64%.
