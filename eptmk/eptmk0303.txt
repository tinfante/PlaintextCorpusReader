18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography in assessment of myeloma-related bone disease: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) had a superior sensitivity for myeloma bone lesions compared with whole body X-ray, and that response monitoring with FDG-PET computed tomography during treatment was promising. Given the limitations of the review and the included studies, the conclusions seem overly strong.
