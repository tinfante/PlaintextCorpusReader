Intensive education improves knowledge, compliance, and foot problems in type 2 diabetes.
Despite the established role of foot care education in diabetes management, reports evaluating such interventions are rare. The effectiveness of an intensive foot care intervention programme and a conventional one were therefore compared in Type 2 diabetes. The intensive group showed significantly greater improvements than the conventional group in foot care knowledge (p less than 0.001), compliance with the recommended foot care routine (p = 0.012), and compliance with the initial advice to consult a podiatrist (other than the project podiatrist) for further treatment (p = 0.008). At the first follow-up visit the intensive group also showed a significantly greater reduction in the number of foot problems requiring treatment than the conventional group.
