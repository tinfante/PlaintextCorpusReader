The safety and efficacy of EGFR TKIs monotherapy versus single-agent chemotherapy using third-generation cytotoxics as the first-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and poor performance status
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and single-agent chemotherapy had low response rates in treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer for patients with poor performance status. EGFR TKIs tended to more effective disease control and had lower toxicity. Quality and process limitations make the reliability of the conclusions unclear.
