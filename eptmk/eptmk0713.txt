Cold knife conization and loop excision for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate whether loop excision is an acceptable alternative to traditional cold knife conization of the cervix. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 240 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were randomly assigned to loop excision (n = 120) or cold knife conization (n = 120). Success and complication rates of both methods were analysed. RESULTS: 100% of cold knife conization and 98% of loop excision surgical specimens were positive for dysplasia. The rate of complete resection was 91% in the cold knife and 82% in the loop excision group, but histologic confirmation of residual CIN was obtained in only 2 (1.7%) women after cold knife conization and in 5 (4.2%) after loop excision. Loop excision cones were significantly shallower than those obtained by a cold knife. Secondary surgical procedures due to early hemorrhage were performed in 9 (7.5%) patients treated with cold knife conization and in 8 (6.7%) treated with loop excision. Elevated temperature postoperatively was observed in 16.4% of patients after cold knife conization and in 13.9% after loop excision. There were no other postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that cold knife conization and loop excision are comparable and equally effective diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for CIN.
