The efficacy of graduated compression stockings in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis after major gynaecological surgery.
The efficacy of graduated compression stockings in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after major gynaecological surgery was investigated in a controlled randomized prospective trial in 196 patients who were greater than 35 years of age. The stockings were worn by 104 of the 196 patients throughout their stay in hospital, the other 92 patients did not wear the stockings (control group). All the patients were scanned for DVT postoperatively with the 125I-labelled fibrinogen test. None of the 104 patients who wore the stockings developed a thromboembolism, but four of the 92 control patients who did not wear the stockings had DVT. This difference between the two groups was statistically significant.
