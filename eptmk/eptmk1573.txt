Pizotifen (Sanomigran) in childhood migraine. A double-blind controlled trial.
Forty-seven children with migraine have been included in a double-blind cross-over study with pizotifen and placebo. The children received either pizotifen for 3 months followed by placebo or vice versa. Thirty-nine children completed the trial and there was no significant difference between active and placebo treatment as regards reduction of number of attacks, total and mean duration of attacks and duration of longest attacks. Pizotifen was well tolerated by the children.
