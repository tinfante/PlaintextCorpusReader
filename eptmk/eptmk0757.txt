Continuing uncertainty about the value of percutaneous revascularization in atherosclerotic renovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review examined the effect of revascularisation on blood pressure and serum creatinine levels in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease. The authors concluded that the results of the meta-analysis exclude the possibility of a large improvement after angioplasty, but a moderate clinical benefit cannot be ruled out. The authors' conclusions are based on a small number of participants, and the methods used in the review may be biased.
