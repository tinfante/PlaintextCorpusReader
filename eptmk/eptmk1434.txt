A systematic review and meta-analysis on the therapeutic equivalence of statins
CRD SUMMARY: This review found reductions of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased with statin dose. Equivalent doses could be found for most statins to achieve common goals of LDL cholesterol levels. The authors' conclusions were based on the evidence presented, but some methodological flaws made the reliability of the conclusions unclear.
