Off-label use of atypical antipsychotics: an update
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that atypical antipsychotics were used for a range of off-label conditions with varied results and it may not be appropriate to assume class effects. The conclusions of this broad review should be considered carefully for each individual condition bearing in mind the acknowledged presence of publication bias, potential language bias and unexplained heterogeneity.
