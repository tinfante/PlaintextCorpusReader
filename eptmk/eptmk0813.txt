Potentiation of radiotherapy by cis-dichlorodiammine platinum (II) in advanced cervical carcinoma.
Forty-five patients with Stages II and III cervical carcinoma were randomized to receive either radiation or cis-dichlorodiammine platinum (II) (cis-DPP) with radiation. Cis-DPP was administered in bolus injections of 25 mg/m2 at weekly intervals until completion of radium application. Complete response was noted in 11/20 (55%) patients in the radiochemotherapy group compared to 5/25 (20%) patients in the radiation group (P less than 0.025). No enhanced toxicities were observed with the addition of cis-DPP to radiation. The combined use of cis-DPP and radiotherapy offers promising potential in improving local-regional control of advanced cervical carcinoma.
