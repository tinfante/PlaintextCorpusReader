Comprehensive evaluation of a model alcohol education curriculum.
A comprehensive evaluation was conducted of a representative alcohol education program designed to enhance knowledge and self-esteem, instill appropriate attitudes and teach the decision-making skills necessary for youth to make responsible decisions about the use of alcohol. The curriculum was implemented approximately as intended. The immediate, cumulative and longer-term effects of curriculum exposure on the variables thought to mediate alcohol use were modest or unsystematic. There was no consistent evidence of carryover effects from curriculum exposure on subsequent use of alcohol, cigarettes or other drugs. The curriculum was ineffective in attaining its goals.
