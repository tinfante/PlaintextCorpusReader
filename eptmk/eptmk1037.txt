Pulsed ultrasound does not improve healing of venous ulcers.
A controlled study of the effects of pulsed ultrasound was carried out in conjunction with a standard treatment for healing chronic leg ulcers on 44 patients divided randomly into two groups. All patients received standard treatment (paste impregnated bandage and a self-adhesive elastic bandage) plus placebo-ultrasound or pulsed ultrasound (1:9, 0.5 watt/cm2 at 1 MHz, for 10 min) 3 days a week for 4 weeks, thereafter twice weekly for 4 weeks and once weekly for the following 4 weeks. Percentage healed ulcer area and comparison of percentage healed ulcers were examined after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. There were no significant differences in the proportion of healed ulcers or ulcer area in the pulsed ultrasound group as compared with the placebo group.
