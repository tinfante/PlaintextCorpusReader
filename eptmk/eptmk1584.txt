Duration of untreated psychosis and cognitive functioning in first-episode patients.
BACKGROUND: The "toxicity" model of duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) suggests that longer DUP will be associated with poorer performance on cognitive tests in first-episode patients.
AIMS: To test this hypothesis on a sample of 113 patients in a community-based early intervention programme for psychosis.
METHOD: Information was collected concerning a number of possible predictors of cognitive functioning including DUP. These were examined for their relation to performance on an extensive battery of cognitive tests administered shortly after the patients' admission to the programme.
RESULTS: Although several variables such as gender, premorbid adjustment, education and handedness predicted cognitive functioning, no relation was found between DUP and performance on any component of the test battery.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings do not provide support for a toxic effect of DUP on cognitive functioning. Other mechanisms through which DUP might affect outcome such as psychological engulfment, social support and adherence to medication are discussed.
