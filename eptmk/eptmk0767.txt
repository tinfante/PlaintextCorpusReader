Effectiveness of antibiotics given before admission in reducing mortality from meningococcal disease: systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed whether antibiotics given before hospital admission reduce mortality from meningitis. The authors concluded that the available studies cannot answer the question because there are likely to be systematic differences in disease severity between treated and untreated groups. The conclusion that the true effect of treatment is uncertain reflects the limitations of the evidence and appears reliable.
