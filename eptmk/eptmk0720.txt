Meta-analysis comparing arthroplasty with internal fixation for displaced femoral neck fracture in the elderly
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that arthroplasty reduced reoperation and complication rates with no difference in mortality compared with internal fixation in the treatment of displaced femoral neck fracture in the elderly. The evidence supported the authors' findings, but methodological shortcomings of the data and variability between trials mean that the conclusions should be interpreted with caution.
