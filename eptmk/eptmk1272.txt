Osteomyelitis: antigranulocyte scintigraphy with 99mTc radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis. Meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the diagnostic accuracy of antigranulocyte scintigraphy with monoclonal antibodies for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. The authors concluded that the sensitivity was 81% and the specificity 77%, so the method, while useful, cannot completely replace established methods. Although the review was rigorously conducted, the conclusions represent an over-interpretation of the results from a relatively small number of patients and may not be reliable.
