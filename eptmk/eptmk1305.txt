Preliminary data from a clinical trial (phase 2) of an acellular pertussis vaccine, J-NIH-6.
In the search for a new and better pertussis vaccine for general vaccination in Sweden, a clinical trial of an adsorbed acellular vaccine from Japan has been performed. The vaccine used was produced by Biken and contained only F-HA and the toxoid of pertussis toxin (LPF). The aims were: To demonstrate the serological response to primary vaccination of this adsorbed acellular vaccine in comparison to a plain whole cell vaccine. To compare the incidence of side reactions between the two types of vaccines and the adjuvant (aluminium phosphate) of the acellular vaccine used as placebo.
