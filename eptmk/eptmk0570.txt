Heparin in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis after myocardial infarction.
A trial of continuous intravenous heparin in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis was undertaken in 48 patients who had suffered a myocardial infarction. Of the 24 control patients who did not receive heparin seven (29%) developed calf vein thrombosis as detected by the radioactive fibrinogen technique. None of the 24 heparinized patients had any evidence of venous thrombosis. This difference is significant at the 1% level.
