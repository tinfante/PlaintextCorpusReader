Obstetric outcomes after conservative treatment for intraepithelial or early invasive cervical lesions: systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that excisional treatments for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are associated with small risks of pregnancy-related morbidities. It is difficult to comment on the strength of the evidence since the quality of the included studies was not assessed and limited study details were reported. In addition, as some studies might have been missed, the reliability of the authors' conclusions is also weakened.
