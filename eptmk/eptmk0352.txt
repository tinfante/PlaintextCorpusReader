An overview of mutual support groups for family caregivers of people with mental health problems: evidence on process and outcomes
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that support groups did benefit caregivers of relatives with mental illness, but there was little evidence of long-term benefit. There was an extensive search and the selected studies had various methods, but the lack of transparency in the review process and the uncertain quality of these studies limit the reliability of the conclusions.
