Consolidation therapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation in adults with acute myeloid leukemia: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared consolidation therapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) and non-myeloablative chemotherapy for adults with acute myeloid leukaemia in first remission. The authors concluded that there is no evidence to support the use of ABMT in these people. This conclusion seems reliable.
