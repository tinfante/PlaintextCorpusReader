Preparing clients for alcoholism treatment: effects on treatment participation and outcomes.
In this study, 126 clients (87 men, 39 women) entering outpatient alcoholism treatment were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 preparatory conditions: a role induction (RI) session, a motivational interview (MI) session, or a no-preparatory session control group (CG). Clients assigned to the MI preparatory condition attended more treatment sessions and had fewer heavy drinking days during and 12 months after treatment relative to CG clients. Clients assigned to MI, relative to CG clients, also had more abstinent days during treatment and during the first 3 months posttreatment, although this difference was not maintained through the remainder of the 12-month follow-up period. Clients assigned to the RI condition showed no significant advantage over those in the CG condition.
