Long-term results of inferior vena cava filters: experiences in a Japanese population.
OBJECTIVE: In this prospective, non-controlled observational study, we evaluated the middle- to long-term results of placement of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter devices in Japanese patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 42 Japanese patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) who underwent percutaneous insertion of IVC filters, follow-up examinations at fixed intervals of 2 years were performed, and the data was evaluated including complications. There were no fatal complications during IVC filter implantation. About 5% of patients with an inserted IVC filter developed symptomatic PTE, another 5% developed asymptomatic PTE. The trapped thrombus was demonstrated in about 22% of the inserted IVC filters. Lower rates of PTE development, occlusion of IVC, and captured thrombus were found in the cases where concurrent use of anticoagulation therapy with filters was used. Trapped thrombi were found in half of IVC filters inserted prophylactically for proximal femoral venous thrombosis. CONCLUSION: These experiences with IVC filters suggest that they are safe and effective for the prevention of PTE in the Japanese population.
