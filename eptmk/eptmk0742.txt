Comparison of conventional treatment and supervised rehabilitation for treatment of acute lateral ankle sprains: a systematic review of the literature
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that there is limited evidence that conventional treatment combined with supervised rehabilitation training may be superior to conventional treatment alone for acute lateral ankle sprain. The authors' conclusion seems reasonable given the small number and poor quality of the studies identified.
