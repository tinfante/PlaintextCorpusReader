Proteinuria and reduced kidney function in living kidney donors: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression
CRD SUMMARY: The authors conclude that live kidney donation is safe. However, it causes a small rise in urinary protein which increases over time, as well as an initial decrease in the glomerular filtration rate which does not worsen over time except when due to normal ageing. Despite limitations associated with poor-quality primary studies, these conclusions appear well supported by the data.
