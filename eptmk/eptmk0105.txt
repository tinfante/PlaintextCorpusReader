Treatment of bowel obstruction after operation for colorectal carcinoma.
Operative therapy is beneficial in patients with bowel obstruction after operation for colorectal carcinoma. The cause of the bowel obstruction is more likely to be benign following colorectal carcinoma than following other malignancies. Also, the period of preoperative nasogastric suction can safely be extended to 3 to 4 days in these patients, since a resolution rate of 28 percent can be achieved with minimal risk of strangulation.
