Do comorbid anxiety disorders in alcohol-dependent patients need specific treatment to prevent relapse?
CRD SUMMARY: This review considered the impact of treating anxiety to prevent relapse in alcohol symptoms in patients with both a diagnosed alcohol use disorder and anxiety. Although the authors could not affirm the need for specific treatment of anxiety in this patient group, they stated that medication and possibly cognitive-behavioural therapy could reduce anxiety. The reviewers' conclusions reflected limitations in the evidence base and highlighted the need for further research in this area.
