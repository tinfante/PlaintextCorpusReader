Portable thermogram technique for topically applied benzydamine cream in acute soft-tissue injuries.
A double-blind, parallel trial was undertaken with 3% benzydamine cream compared with a matching placebo, on patients suffering acute soft-tissue injuries. 21 patients received active material and 22 received placebo material. Patients applied the cream lightly 6 times a day for 6 days. Assessments were made (by the same physician) on days 0, 2, 4 and 6, and signs and symptoms were graded as "absent", "slight", "moderate" or "severe". Thermograms were taken on day 0 and day 6. The results showed significant relief of spontaneous pain, significant reduction in tenderness on pressure and in swelling on days 2, 4 and 6 of the trial, and a significant reduction in functional impairment on days 4 and 6, in the patients who had received the 3% benzydamine cream.
