Very early initiation of statin therapy and mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome
CRD SUMMARY: The review found that statins may reduce one-month mortality following acute coronary syndrome if treatment is initiated on the first day of hospitalisation. These conclusions require cautious interpretation due to limitations in the review that included potential publication bias, failure to assess study quality and poor reporting.
