A single blind, prospective, randomized trial comparing n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive (Indermil) and sutures for skin closure in hand surgery.
Fifty patients underwent a variety of hand operations and were randomized for wound closure either with tissue adhesive (Indermil) or sutures. The two treatment groups had similar demographic characteristics and similar outcomes at the 2 and 6 week postoperative assessments which were performed by a designated tissue viability nurse blinded to the method of closure. Five minor wound dehiscences occurred: three in the adhesive group and two in the suture group. No infection occurred in either group. In conclusion, the study demonstrates tissue adhesive is as effective as suture in this type of hand surgery.
