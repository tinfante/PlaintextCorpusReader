Gabexate mesilate vs aprotinin in human acute pancreatitis (GA.ME.P.A.). A prospective, randomized, double-blind multicenter study.
The authors report the results of a randomized, double-blind multicenter clinical trial on the use of gabexate mesilate vs aprotinin in the therapy of acute pancreatitis. The size of the study sample and the end points chosen for evaluation of the early systemic complications of the pancreatitis--carefully selected targets for reliable assessment of the efficacy of any protease inhibitor--lead to the conclusion that gabexate mesilate is more efficacious than aprotinin in reducing the early complications of necrotizing acute pancreatitis, if administered within 72 h of onset of symptoms. Its good tolerability means that it can be used safely even at the dose of 3 g/24 h.
