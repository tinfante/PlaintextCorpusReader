CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effect of extended low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis after hospital discharge on symptomatic venous thromboembolism in elective hip arthroplasty patients. The authors concluded that previous studies may have overestimated the effect and impact of such treatment. The conclusions are likely to be reliable.
