Benefits of polychemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma.
The benefits of polychemotherapy in advanced (Stage III) non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma remain uncertain. In attempt to answer the important question whether treatment improves well-being and survival in these patients, we did a prospective, randomized, single-blind study to compare polychemotherapy to a placebo. Thirty-nine consecutive patients were enrolled. Twenty received a drug combination consisting of: methotrexate, doxorubicine hydrochloride (Adriamycin), cyclophosphamide, and lomustine (CCNU) (MACC). The other group (19 subjects) received a placebo physically comparable to MACC. The two groups were initially comparable in terms of age, sex, clinical status, and tumor burden. In the treated group, seven patients had a radiologic response (more than 50% reduction in the tumor size), and the tumor stabilized in an additional five subjects. There were no responders in the placebo group. Median survival was 30.5 weeks for the MACC group compared to 8.5 weeks in the placebo group (P less than 0.0005, Gehan-Wilcoxon). We conclude that polychemotherapy (in this case MACC) significantly benefits patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
