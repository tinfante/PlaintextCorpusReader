[The effectiveness of intravaginal estriol tablet administration in women with urge incontinence].
In postmenopausal patients, stress and urge incontinence often occur as a consequence of oestrogen deficiency. We performed a comparative study in a prospectively randomised and placebo controlled group of women with urge incontinence to investigate different dosages of intravaginally applied oestriol. Clinical and urodynamic parameters were also compared. 15 women (Group I) received 1 mg oestriol applied daily intravaginally over 3 weeks; 15 women (Group II) received a daily dosage of 3 mg and 10 women received a placebo. A complete clinical and urodynamic evaluation was carried out twice at a 4-week interval. The women receiving a daily dose of 3 mg oestriol applied intravaginally demonstrated a significant improvement of the parameters strong desire to void, pollakisuria, and nycturia. No improvement was seen in patients with motoric urge incontinence.
