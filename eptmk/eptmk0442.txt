Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery and acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This generally well-conducted review found that compared to on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, off-pump CABG surgery may be associated with a lower rate of acute kidney injury but may not affect dialysis requirement. Clinical variations across the trials precluded firm conclusions. The authors' cautious conclusions are likely to be reliable.
