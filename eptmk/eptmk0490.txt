Menopausal hormone therapy and risk of breast cancer: a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies and randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the association between menopausal hormone regimens and the risk of breast cancer (BC) over time. The authors concluded that hormone therapy, particularly oestrogen-progestin therapy, has increased the risk of BC in recent years. Poor reporting of review methods, no assessment of study quality, and the synthesis of studies of differing designs make the reliability of the conclusions uncertain.
