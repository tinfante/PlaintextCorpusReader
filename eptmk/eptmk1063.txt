Does routine home visiting improve the return rate and outcome of DOTS patients who delay treatment?
Over a period of 6 months the effect of home visits on compliance with directly observed therapy, short course (DOTS), was studied on 480 new smear-positive tuberculosis patients who had delayed collecting their drugs on one occasion. Patients registered at 15 tuberculosis treatment centres in Baghdad, Iraq, were randomized to an intervention group (receiving home visits from trained personnel) or a control group. Home visits were highly effective in improving the return to treatment of patients who were late for treatment (231/240, 96.3%). The intervention group showed a higher treatment success rate (94.2% versus 76.7%), lower default rate (0.8% versus 10.0%) and higher smear conversion rate after the end of treatment (92.9% versus 75.0%) than controls. Home visiting by trained personnel significantly improves patient compliance with DOTS.
