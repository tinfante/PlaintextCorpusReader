The economic impact of a multifactorial intervention to improve postoperative rehabilitation of hip fracture patients.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost savings associated with a patient education and high-intensity strength intervention to improve rehabilitation after hip fracture. METHODS: Economic analysis conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial, using cost-benefit ratios and net present value statistics. Study subjects were aged over 64 years and were followed for 18 months postsurgery. Resource utilization data were gathered by telephone questionnaire. Medicare reimbursement rates and prevailing costs for services not covered by Medicare were used to convert utilization patterns into costs. Intervention costs were obtained from program records. RESULTS: The cost of the intervention was $722 per patient. Over the followup period, median costs were $11,941 and $21,577 for the intervention and control groups, respectively, yielding an average program benefit of $9,636. Cost-benefit ratios exceeded 4.5, and net present value exceeded $150,974. CCONCLUSION:The results indicate that the benefits of the intervention exceeded its costs.
