Effect of cyclosporin A on serum lipids in primary biliary cirrhosis patients.
Hyperlipidemia is a common complication of PBC. Ten patients with serologically and histologically defined PBC were randomized to receive either oral cyclosporin A (CyA) or placebo for one year. Fasting blood samples were obtained from subjects at the beginning, and following one year of treatment, for plasma lipids, apolipoproteins AI (apo AI) and B (apo B), and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity. On entry to the study there were no significant differences between groups for serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), free cholesterol (FC), total phospholipids (TPL), apo AI, apo B and LCAT activity. Compared to normal laboratory values, baseline TC was elevated in 5/10, LDL-C in 5/10, TPL in 6/10, while LCAT activity was decreased in 8/10 patients. The percent change after one year for CyA group vs the placebo group are as follows: total cholesterol, -22 vs -8%; LDL cholesterol -33 vs -25%; free cholesterol, -39 vs -14%; total phospholipids, -46 vs -23%; and LCAT activity, +/- 236 vs +/- 43%. The decrease in TC, LDL-C, FC, TPL with increase in LCAT activity suggests that CyA administration is associated with improvement in the lipid abnormalities of PBC.
