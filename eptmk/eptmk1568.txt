Non-surgical management of piriformis syndrome: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated conservative non-surgical management of Piriformis Syndrome. The authors' conclusions appeared to be that Botox injections may be an effective treatment for Piriformis Syndrome and that further research is recommended. This was a poorly reported review, with methodological weaknesses identified within a very limited evidence base. The extent to which the authors' conclusions are reliable is unclear.
