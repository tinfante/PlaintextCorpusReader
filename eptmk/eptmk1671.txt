Topical chlorhexidine for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review reported that topical application of chlorhexidine is useful for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients. This was a well-conducted review, but the conclusions should have been slightly more cautious given the clinical and statistical differences between the studies and the unknown quality of some of the included trials.
