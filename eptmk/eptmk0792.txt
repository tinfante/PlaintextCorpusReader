The effect of surgical drain together with a secondary closure technique on postoperative trismus, swelling and pain after mandibular third molar surgery.
This investigation compared the results of 2 types of wound closure after mandibular third molar removal. In both the test group and the control group, the molars were removed using a mucoperiosteal flap as described by Szmyd; a wedge of tissue distal to the second molar was removed before closure to secure self-irrigation of the empty socket. The test group received a gauze drain partially submerged into the socket to secure more drainage and to prevent primary wound healing. Examinations were performed 2 days and 7 days after surgery, and pain, swelling, trismus and wound condition were recorded. Analyses of variance indicated that there was no significant difference between the 2 types of wound closure.
