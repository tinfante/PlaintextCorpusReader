Prevention of deep vein thrombosis in knee arthroplasty. Preliminary results from a randomized controlled study of low molecular weight heparin vs foot pump compression.
BACKGROUND: We evaluated in a randomized controlled study the possibility to use foot pump mechanical compression compared to routine LMWH as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis during knee arthroplasty. METHODS: Forty patients were included in this preliminary report. Eleven patients withdrew, usually during the early phase of the study. RESULTS: Among the 29 patients completing a venography, 27% in the compression group and none in the LMWH group had a DVT. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). One further patient in the compression group died from pulmonary embolism 17 days postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: With the present study protocol, mechanical foot pump compression failed to be as efficient as LMWH prophylaxis.
