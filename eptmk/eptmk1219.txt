Heparin therapy, deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after intracerebral hemorrhage.
A prospective randomized pilot study of subcutaneous low-dose heparin in the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was carried out in patients admitted to hospital after intracerebral hemorrhage. A high incidence of deep-vein thrombosis and lung embolism was detected by phleboscintigraphy and lung perfusion scintigraphy, respectively. There was no significant reduction of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in the therapy group. Heparin did not increase the risk of rebleeding.
