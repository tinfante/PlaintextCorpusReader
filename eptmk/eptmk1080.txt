Steroid withdrawal in renal transplant patients on triple therapy with a calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effects of steroid withdrawal from triple therapy with cyclosporine or tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. The authors concluded that steroid withdrawal increases acute rejection but not early graft failure. Given the limitations of the review, and the poor reporting of some review methodology, it is not possible to guarantee the reliability of the conclusions.
