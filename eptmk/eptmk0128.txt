Ultrasonic dating of pregnancies: effect on incidence of SGA diagnoses. A randomised controlled trial.
In order to study the incidence of antenatal identification and postnatal diagnosis of small for gestational age (SGA) infants, 4997 women with optimal menstrual history were randomised. One group had the gestational age estimated from last menstrual period (LMP), the other from ultrasonographically measured biparietal diameter (BPD) in the second trimester. Both the incidence of antenatally suspected and postnatally diagnosed SGA infants were reduced by approximately 30% in the BPD-dated group. It is concluded that this was due to the shift in gestational age estimation.
