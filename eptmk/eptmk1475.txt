Management of treatment-resistant epilepsy. Volumes 1: evidence report and appendices. Volume 2: evidence tables. Diagnosis
CRD SUMMARY: This review planned to evaluate which methods of re-evaluating refractory epilepsy can lead to improved patient outcomes. The authors addressed a different question, and concluded it was unclear whether blood prolactin levels can differentiate between epileptic and non-eplieptic seizures. The conclusion seems appropriate given that it was based on only five poor-quality trials and no review methodology was reported.
