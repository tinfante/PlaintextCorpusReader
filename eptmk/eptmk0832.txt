High prevalence of viral genomes and inflammation in peripartum cardiomyopathy.
Molecular pathologic investigation of endomyocardial biopsy specimens from 26 patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy revealed viral genomes (parvovirus B19, human herpes virus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, and human cytomegalovirus) in 8 patients (30.7%) that were associated immunohistologically with interstitial inflammation. These findings indicate a high prevalence of virus-associated inflammatory changes in peripartum cardiomyopathy.
