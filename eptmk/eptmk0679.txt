Occlusive therapy in atopic dermatitis: overview
CRD SUMMARY: The review concluded that the available data on the role of occlusive therapy in atopic dermatitis were encouraging but limited by the lack of adequate study controls and standardised designs. Although there were some methodological problems with the review which limit its reliability, the authors' conclusions were suitably cautious and appear reasonable.
