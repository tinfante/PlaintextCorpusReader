Efficacy of oral vs. topical, or combined oral and topical 5-aminosalicylates, in ulcerative colitis: systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that combined 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) appeared superior to oral 5-ASAs in inducing remission of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Topical 5-ASAs may be superior to oral 5-ASAs in preventing relapse of quiescent ulcerative colitis. Given the small number and low quality of available studies, the authors were appropriately tentative in their conclusions.
