Soy for the treatment of perimenopausal symptoms: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effectiveness and safety of soy products for the treatment of perimenopausal symptoms such as hot flushes. The authors concluded that soy products are safe to use in the short-term and that there was some evidence that they were effective, though definitive conclusions were not possible. The authors' conclusions are appropriate, but it should be noted that many of the studies found no evidence of effectiveness.
