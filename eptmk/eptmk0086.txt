The prophylactic use of propylic ester of p-hydrobenzoic acid on alveolitis sicca dolorosa. A preliminary report.
A double-blind experiment was performed to test the possible prophylactic effect of the antifibrinolytically active propylic ester of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PEPH) on alveolitis sicca dolorosa (dry socket). Tablets containing PEPH or placebo were inserted at random selection into the alveoli of forty-five consecutive patients, each of whom had had an impacted mandibular third molar removed. The prophylactic effect of PEPH in this study was found to be highly significant as compared to that of placebo, and no patients in the experimental group developed alveolitis sicca dolorosa.
