A systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of rapid immunochromatographic assays for the detection of dengue virus IgM antibodies during acute infection
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that rapid immunochromatographic tests can be used to rule in and out infection with dengue virus, but are more accurate when samples are collected later in the acute phase of infection. These findings are supported by the results presented, but should be interpreted with caution given the limitations in the searches and the presence of significant variability between studies.
