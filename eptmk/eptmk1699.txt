Comparison of the analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen and aspirin for postsurgical dental pain.
The analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen 25 mg and 50 mg compared with aspirin 650 mg and placebo (lactose) was evaluated. Subjects were 164 dental outpatients undergoing the surgical removal of impacted teeth. Each subject received a single dose of study medication and was evaluated hourly for six hours. Aspirin was superior to placebo in all measures of analgesic efficacy, and both dosages of flurbiprofen were superior to aspirin.
