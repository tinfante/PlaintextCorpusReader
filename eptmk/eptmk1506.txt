Regional pharmacokinetics educational program.
An educational program for hospital pharmacists in and near Vermont is described and its impact on departmental clinical practice evaluated. Pharmacists were instructed by practitioners from a single institution in basic pharmacokinetics, practice guidelines for aminoglycoside therapy, and use of a computer program for aminoglycoside dosage determination. Participants completed a multiple-choice precourse test, a similar postcourse test, and a third test six months after class completion. Test scores were compared with those from a control group of pharmacists. Pharmacy directors from study group hospitals completed questionnaires measuring aminoglycoside clinical services before and six months after the program. Compared with the control group, participants scored higher on the postcourse tests. Results from the questionnaire indicate that the program affected clinical practice in almost all participating pharmacy departments. A consistent pharmacokinetic strategy for reviewing aminoglycoside dosages and evaluating serum aminoglycoside concentrations is now practiced in most Vermont hospitals. An educational program originating in one hospital can expand pharmacists' knowledge and influence departmental clinical practice throughout a region.
