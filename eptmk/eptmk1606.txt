Promoting evidence-based education in tissue viability.
The introduction of the UKCC Scope of Professional Practice (1992a) has encouraged many practitioners to develop their practice in specific areas of nursing including tissue viability. As a result, practitioners wish to develop their knowledge to ensure they deliver the most effective evidence-based care to patients. The author discusses the importance of evidence-based tissue viability education, which integrates input from educationalists and clinicians.
