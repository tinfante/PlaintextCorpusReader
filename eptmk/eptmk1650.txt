Immunonutrition in gastrointestinal surgery
CRD SUMMARY: The review found that immunonutrition decreased morbidity and hospital stay, but not mortality, after major gastrointestinal elective surgery; tolerance of enteral feeding with immunonutrition was similar to that with standard formula. Given the potential for bias and error in some parts of the review process, this conclusion should be interpreted cautiously.
