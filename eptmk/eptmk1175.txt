Outcomes of conservative therapy for young women with early endometrial adenocarcinoma.
Four of six patients with endometrial cancer had initial response to progesterone therapy and obtained complete response; three among them had successful pregnancies with three live births. The results suggest that progesterone therapy, combined with assisted reproductive technology, provides more chance of carrying a full-term pregnancy for patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma.
