Double-blind comparison of clozapine with chlorpromazine in acute schizophrenic illness.
Double Blind comparative trial of a new dibenzodiazepine derivative Clozapine (Leponex) with Chlorpromazine was conducted in the treatment of acute schizophrenic illness over a 6 week period. Factor Analysis of ratings in 9 matched pairs indicates that Clozapine, at 300 mg. per day, is comparable in efficacy to Chlorpromazine in all factors except "Irritability" for which Clozapine appears to be superior. Illness severity and Global Change ratings in all patients showed that Clozapine is more effective in producting a shift towards improvement at the end of 6 weeks. Major side effects reported in Clozapine confirmed sedation and hypersalivation as consistent problems and presence of rigidity and tremor (extra-pyramidal) being at variance with other studies.
