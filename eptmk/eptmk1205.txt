[Clinical observation on the target therapy of rh-endostin, combined with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.].
BACKGROUND: The chemotherapy of advanced non-small cell lung cancer is in a Bottleneck. The target therapy of Anti-angiogenesis gradually shows an advantage in the therapy of patients with advanced NSCLC. To investigate the short-term efficacy, safety and the quality of life of the target therapy of rh-Endostin combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.
METHODS: Sixty-two advanced NSCLC patients were randomly divided into either the trial group with chemotherapy plus rh-Endostin or control group with chemotherapy alone. The efficacy and toxicity were evaluated after 2 cycles according to RECIST criteria.
RESULTS: The trial groups efficiency rate was 46.87%, while the control group was 26.66%, there was no significant differences of two groups (Chi-square=1.912, P=0.166). The clinical benefit rate was 81.25% in the trial group and 53.33% in control group. There was significant difference of the clinical benefit rate between the trial group and the control group (Chi-square=4.3185, P=0.0377). The score of quality of life in the trial group was significantly higher than that the control group after the treatment (Chi-square=11.233, P=0.0008). There was no significant difference of incidence of toxicities between the trial group and the control group (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Rh-Endostin combined with chemotherapy was effective, reasonable, safe and well tolerated for advanced NSCLC.
