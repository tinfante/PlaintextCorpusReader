The effectiveness of topical negative pressure in the treatment of pressure ulcers: a literature review
CRD SUMMARY: This narrative review of the effectiveness of topical negative pressure in the treatment of pressure ulcers concluded that topical negative pressure was not proven to be more effective than other interventions. The reliability of these conclusions is limited by the small size of included studies and the lack of information on participants, outcomes, study selection and data extraction.
