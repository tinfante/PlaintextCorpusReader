Immediate postpartum insertion: performance of the Nova-T-PP and randomized comparison with the Nova-T.
Clinical evaluation of the Postpartum Nova-T or Nova-T-PP (a Nova-T IUD adapted for postpartum insertion) was based on 412 insertions and showed that this model--besides being effective and safe--had a low expulsion rate (7.2% at 1 year). To prove that the Nova-T-PP's low expulsion rate is indeed the result of its special design, a randomized trial was conducted to compare the Nova-T-PP with the parent model (Nova-T) when inserted within 10 minutes of delivery of the placenta. The result of this study (408 insertions, 203 of them Nova-T) indicate that there is no significant difference in expulsion rate between the two IUD models, suggesting that the addition of two extra arms to the original Nova-T model does not improve the retention of the adapted IUD model.
