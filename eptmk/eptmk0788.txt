Diagnostic performance of dual-time 18F-FDG PET in the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that dual time-point 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) had similar sensitivity and specificity to single time-point FDG-PET in the diagnosis of malignant pulmonary nodules, with no additional value. Weaknesses in the reporting and analytic methods and the absence of data on single time-point FDG-PET make these conclusions unreliable.
