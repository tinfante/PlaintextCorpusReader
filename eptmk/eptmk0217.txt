Nonopioid additives to local anaesthetics for caudal blockade in children: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effect of adding nonopioid agents to local anaesthetic agents for caudal blockade in children. The authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of adding clonidine, ketamine or midazolam to local anaesthetic agents. The authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable.
