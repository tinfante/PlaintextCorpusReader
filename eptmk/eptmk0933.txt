Soft tissue trauma: a randomised controlled trial of the topical application of felbinac, a new NSAID.
Two hundred and thirty-one patients with acute soft tissue injuries were treated in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of felbinac (biphenylacetic acid) gel applied three times daily to the injured site. Those treated with felbinac had significantly greater improvement at Day 4 (p less than 0.001) and Day 7 (p less than 0.02) than those who received placebo. Patients' self-assessment diary cards confirmed superiority of the active treatment as early as Day 2 of the study. Local skin reactions were few (three per cent), mild and recovered spontaneously. Felbinac is an effective management for acute soft tissue injuries and because of its topical application may be safer than oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of these conditions.
