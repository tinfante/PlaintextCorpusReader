The use of graduated compression stockings in the prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis.
The efficacy of graduated compression stockings in the prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis was studied in a randomized, prospective, controlled trial of 200 patients, aged 40 years and over, undergoing abdominal surgery (100 for benign disease, 100 for malignant conditions). Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by the 125I-fibrinogen test. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 35.9 per cent in the control group (103 patients) and 15.5 per cent in the stockinged group (97 patients) (P less than 0.025). In the patients with benign disease, deep vein thrombosis developed in 24.5 per cent of the control limbs and 6.1 per cent of stockinged limbs (P less than 0.005); in patients with malignant disease the similar figures were 27.9 and 11.5 per cent (P less than 0.05). Increasing age did not alter the efficacy of the stockings. It is concluded that graduated compression stockings provide a safe and effective method of prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis.
