Drug prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis. A compararative study of calcium heparinate and sodium pentosan polysulfate.
Deep vein thrombosis and its sequel, pulmonary embolus, are possibly the greatest threats to recovery after surgical operation. In a randomized, controlled clinical trial in which the 125I-fibrinogen uptake test, Doppler ultrasound, and phlebography were used for diagnosis, it was found that low doses of calcium heparinate administered subcutaneously and sodium pentosan polysulfate intramuscularly were effective in preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), postoperatively. The incidence of DVT was as follows: 9% in the group treated with heparinate; 15% in the group treated with sodium pentosan polysulfate; nad 51% in the untreated control group.
