Psychological interventions for arthritis pain management in adults: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that psychosocial interventions may have significant effects beyond those of standard medical care on pain and other outcomes in adults with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. However, the review methods were unclear and there were problems with the analysis which may affect the reliability of the pooled effect sizes. The conclusions should therefore be interpreted cautiously.
