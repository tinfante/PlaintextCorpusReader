Effects of interventions involving the family in the treatment of adult patients with chronic physical diseases: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that psychosocial interventions that involved family members in the treatment of chronic physical diseases had positive effects on health outcome for the patient and his/her family. Further high-quality research was needed to investigate differential effects. High levels of heterogeneity in the analyses made the reliability of the authors' conclusions unclear.
