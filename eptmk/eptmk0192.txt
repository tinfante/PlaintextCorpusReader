Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin in outpatients with plaster-cast immobilisation of the leg.
Deep-vein thrombosis is common after plaster-cast immobilisation for traumatic injury. We did a randomised prospective study of the effect of low-molecular-weight heparin on the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis in patients with minor injuries treated with plaster-cast immobilisation of the leg. A control group (n = 163) received no prophylaxis, the prophylaxis group received low-molecular-weight heparin once daily (n = 176). The incidence of deep-vein thrombosis in the prophylaxis group was 0% (one tailed p < 0.006) vs 4.3% in the control group. No severe side-effects of low-molecular-weight heparin were observed. Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin once daily is effective in reducing the risk of deep-vein thrombosis in outpatients with plaster-cast immobilisation of the leg.
