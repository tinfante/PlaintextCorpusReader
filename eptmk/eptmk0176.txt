Spontaneous recovery of language in patients with aphasia between 4 and 34 weeks after stroke.
The paper describes the spontaneous recovery of language abilities of 52 stroke patients who were aphasic for more than 4 weeks. These patients had been randomly allocated to receive no speech therapy and had been assessed at 6-weekly intervals after a stroke. There was improvement in language abilities over time. Age, sex and aphasia type were not related to the amount of improvement. An aphasic patient's level of language ability at 6 months could be predicted on the basis of the test score on the Porch Index of Communicative Ability at 4 weeks.
