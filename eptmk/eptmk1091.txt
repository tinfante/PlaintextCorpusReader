Comparison of the efficacy of cooled-tip and 8-mm-tip catheters for radiofrequency catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The authors of this review concluded that cooled-tip and 8-mm-tip catheters are equally effective and safe for catheter ablation. Review limitations included incomplete reporting of review methods and the lack of an assessment of study quality. In addition, the review provided evidence of no statistically significant difference between cooled-tip and 8-mm-tip catheters rather than equivalence of the two interventions.
