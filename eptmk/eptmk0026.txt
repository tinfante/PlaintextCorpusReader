Extended use of glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is well tolerated and maintains its clinical effect on multiple sclerosis relapse rate and degree of disability. Copolymer 1 Multiple Sclerosis Study Group.
When 251 relapsing-remitting patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections of glatiramer acetate, previously called copolymer 1 (Copaxone; n = 125) or placebo (n = 126) for 24 months, there were no laboratory abnormalities associated with glatiramer acetate treatment and it was well tolerated with few side effects. Patients receiving glatiramer acetate had significantly fewer relapses and were more likely to be neurologically improved, whereas those receiving placebo were more likely to worsen. This study was extended for 1 to 11 months (mean of 5.2 months for the glatiramer acetate group and 5.9 months for the placebo group). The blinding and study conditions used during the core 24-month study were unchanged throughout the extension. The results of this extension study confirm the excellent tolerance and safety profile of glatiramer acetate for injection. The clinical benefit of glatiramer acetate for both the relapse rate and for neurologic disability was sustained at the end of the extension trial.
