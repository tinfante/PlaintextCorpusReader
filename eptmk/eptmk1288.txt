Outcome after treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis: results from a systematic review using meta-analysis techniques
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the clinical outcome after treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis. Treatment of in-stent restenosis was associated with an overall 30% rate of major adverse cardiac events. The review's findings should be interpreted with caution given the lack of clarity in the statistical analysis, the lack of details on included studies and a confusing presentation of the results.
