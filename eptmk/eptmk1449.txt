A follow-up study of patients advised to obtain influenza immunizations.
Computers have been used in general practice to issue reminders to patients overdue for preventive procedures. Although effective, issuing reminders may be inconsistent with the belief that patients should take responsibility for their own health. To assess the effect of a reminder on subsequent use of influenza prevention services, this study examined the three-year immunization behavior of 1,175 patients 65 years or older who were part of a randomized controlled trial. During the middle year only, reminders were issued to patients in the experimental group. A comparison of immunization patterns over the three years in experimental and control groups indicated that the reminder both promoted independent action and engendered dependency on the reminder. The former, favorable effect was more frequent among younger patients; the latter, adverse effect was more common among older patients who visited the practice more frequently.
