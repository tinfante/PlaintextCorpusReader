Hyperfractionated radiation therapy with or without concurrent low-dose daily carboplatin/etoposide for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: a randomized study.
PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of concurrent hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HFX RT) and low-dose daily chemotherapy (CHT) in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1990 and December 1991, 131 patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed stage III NSCLC, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) > or = 50, and no previous therapy were randomly treated as follows: group I, HFX RT with 1.2 Gy twice daily to a total dose of 69.6 Gy (n = 66); and group II, same HFX RT with CHT consisting of 50 mg of carboplatin (CBDCA) and 50 mg of etoposide (VP-16) given on each RT day (n = 65). RESULTS: Group II patients had a significantly longer survival time than group I patients, with a median survival of 22 versus 14 months and 4-year survival rates of 23% versus 9% (P = .021). The median time to local recurrence and 4-year local recurrence-free survival rate were also significantly higher in group II than in group I (25 v 20 months and 42% v 19% respectively, P = .015). In contrast, the distant metastasis-free survival rate did not significantly differ in the two groups (P = .33). The two groups showed similar incidence of acute and late high-grade toxicity (P = .44 and .75, respectively). No treatment-related toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: The combination of HFX RT and low-dose daily CBDCA plus VP-16 was tolerable and improved the survival of patients with stage III NSCLC as a result of improved local control.
