Controlled clinical trial of doxorubicin and tamoxifen versus doxorubicin alone in hepatocellular carcinoma.
Following reports that specific estrogen receptors could be detected in samples of hepatocellular carcinoma tissue, a prospective randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 59 patients, half of whom received doxorubicin (60 mg/m2 at 3-week intervals) and half doxorubicin and tamoxifen (10 mg twice per day). Response occurred in three (11%) of those patients receiving doxorubicin alone and in four (16%) of those given both drugs. This difference was not statistically significant nor was the difference in survival when compared by life-table analysis. One patient treated with both drugs achieved complete remission for 30 months which was maintained (on tamoxifen alone) for 18 months before death from a non-tumor-related condition. Tamoxifen may have a role in maintenance of doxorubicin-induced remissions.
