Pharmaceutical Care for Hospitalized HIV-Infected Patients Compared to Infectious Diseases Consult Patients Without HIV Infection
This study evaluated differences in pharmaceutical care (PC) between hospitalized HIV-infection patients and Infectious Disease (ID) consult patients without HIV infection. Twelve HIV-infected in-patients and 19 ID consult in-patients treated at a veterans Affair Medical Centre were monitored by an ID/HIV pharmacotherapy post-doctoral resident under the supervision of an ID-trained faculty member. Pharmacotherapy intervention were categorized by type, clinical significance and expected patient outcome. Of 218 interventions, 139 (64%) were for HIV-infected patients compared to 79 (36%) for ID consult patients. Significantly more interventions in the HIV-infected group were expected to enhance the therapeutic effect of a drug regimen (p < 0.05). A pharmacist with an expertise in ID/HIV pharmacotherapy may enhance therapeutic outcomes of HIV-infected-in-patients.
