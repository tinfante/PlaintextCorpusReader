Effects of a single course of corticosteroids given more than 7 days before birth: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that exposure to a single course of prenatal corticosteroids administered more than 7 days before birth does not reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, but can increase the risk of perinatal mortality, earlier birth and maternal infectious morbidity. The review was generally well-conducted and, despite a few methodological considerations, the conclusions are likely to be reliable.
