Non-curricular approaches for increasing physical activity in youth: a review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effectiveness of non-curricular interventions for increasing physical activity in children and adolescents. The authors concluded that physical activity can be increased during break periods, through existing organisations, summer day camps and perhaps using active transportation. The limited search, poor reporting of the methods and lack of a quality assessment mean that the conclusions are not robust.
