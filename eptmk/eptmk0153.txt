Effects of statin treatment on cardiac function in patients with chronic heart failure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that statin treatment might time-dependently increase left ventricular ejection fraction and may reduce left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left-ventricular end-systolic diameter, B-type natriuretic peptide and New York Heart Association functional class in patients with chronic heart failure. Given the low quality of included studies and the presence of statistical heterogeneity, the authors' conclusions should be treated with caution.
