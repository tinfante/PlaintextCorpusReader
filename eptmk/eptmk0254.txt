A review of alternative treatments for tinnitus
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the effectiveness of alternative treatments for tinnitus. The authors concluded that hypnotherapy improved some subjective measures. Some of the methods used to conduct the review were not reported and the conclusions were based on evidence from two small, apparently methodologically flawed, studies. Consequently, the evidence was very limited.
