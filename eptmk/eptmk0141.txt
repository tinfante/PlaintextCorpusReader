One-leg standing test for elderly populations
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that the one-leg standing test could be used to predict frailty in community-dwelling elderly people. Some interventions to improve balance, resistance and strength/endurance seemed to improve one-leg standing times. Given a lack of reporting of the review process, potential for missed studies and the paucity of good-quality evidence, the result should be interpreted with caution.
