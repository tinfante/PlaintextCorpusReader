Effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of acute major depression in adults: a systematic re-examination of published and unpublished data from randomized trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the effectiveness and acceptability of paroxetine in major depression, concluding paroxetine was not superior to placebo in terms of the proportion of study participants discontinuing treatment for any reason. Paoxetine had a modest effect in terms of depression measures. The conclusions appeared broadly appropriate, although they possibly overemphasised the less meaningful efficacy outcome of treatment withdrawal.
