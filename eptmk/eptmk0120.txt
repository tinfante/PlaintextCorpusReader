Double-blind comparison of meclofenamate sodium plus codeine, meclofenamate sodium, codeine, and placebo for relief of pain following surgical removal of third molars.
A single-dose, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment study was performed in 200 outpatients with acute pain caused by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, meclofenamate 100 mg, codeine 60 mg, and placebo treatment groups were compared for sum of pain intensity differences, peak pain intensity difference, sum of pain relief scores, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved, overall evaluation of effectiveness, and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was significantly more effective (P less than .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except number of observations at which pain was half relieved. Both meclofenamate-codeine combinations and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were significantly more effective (P less than .005) than placebo for all variables. Eleven adverse experiences were reported in 7 patients (3.5%); the most common was somnolence in 1 patient receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, in 2 treated with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and in 1 treated with codeine 60 mg.
