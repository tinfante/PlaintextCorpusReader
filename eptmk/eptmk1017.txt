Three years of experience after post-abortal insertion of Nova-T and Copper-T-200.
The results of 3 years of follow-up of a randomized comparative study of 331 women who had an IUD inserted immediately after a first-trimester legal abortion are presented. In one group of women, 172 Nova-T were inserted and in another, 159 Copper-T 200. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups, though the pregnancy rate for Nova-T was considerable lower than for Copper-T 200. The overall performance of the IUD equals that in a larger material of more than 1 800 insertions, both post menstrual and post abortal , of which this study is a part.
