Efficacy and safety of abciximab on acute myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: The use of abciximab as an adjuvant treatment to percutaneous coronary interventions for acute myocardial infarction reduced mortality, major cardiac events and revascularisation. This occurred with stenting, but not with balloon angioplasty. A 70 U/kg heparin bolus must be used to prevent major bleeding. The methodological quality of the included studies was not reported, so the results should be interpreted with caution.
