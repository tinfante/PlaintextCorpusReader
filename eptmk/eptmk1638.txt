Azithromycin in upper respiratory tract infections: a clinical trial in children with otitis media.
Azithromycin is a newly developed azalide antibiotic which is very active against microbes causing respiratory tract infections; tissue concentrations remain elevated for a long time after discontinuation of treatment. A clinical study was conducted to compare azithromycin (10 mg/kg administered as a single daily dose for 3 days) with amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (50 mg/kg/day given b.i.d. for 10 days) in 30 children with otitis media. Sensitivity testing demonstrated good azithromycin activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. By day 12, clinical cure was recorded in 14/15 children treated with azithromycin and this was maintained at day 30. In the day 12 and 13/15 children by day 30. It was concluded that a 3-day azithromycin regimen produces a satisfactory clinical response and the eradication of key pathogens, and was acceptable for children.
