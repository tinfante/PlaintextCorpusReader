Controlled clinical trial with Fentiazac cream in sport microtraumatology.
Fentiazac 5% cream was applied topically on limited articular and extra-articular inflammatory lesions in the course of a double-blind clinical trial versus placebo. The drug proved to be satisfactorily tolerated and also therapeutically effective since it changed significantly (p less than 0.05--less than 0.01) the spontaneous course of the microtraumatic pathologic pattern producing an early attenuation and resolution of the painful and functional symptomatic pattern.
