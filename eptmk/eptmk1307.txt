No improvement in neurocognitive outcomes after off-pump versus on-pump coronary revascularisation: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that there were no convincing differences in neurocognitive outcomes between patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and those who underwent on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. These conclusions reflected the evidence presented. The review was generally well conducted and the authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable.
