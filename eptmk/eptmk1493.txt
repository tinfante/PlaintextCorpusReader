A systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and toxicity of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and biological agents for psoriatic arthritis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that gold, sulfasalazine, leflunomide and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors are effective in treating psoriatic arthritis compared to controls, but toxicity was greater. Given the methodological differences between included studies, and limitations in the reporting of the review, such as inconsistencies between the conclusions and statistical analysis, the reliability of the authors' conclusions is uncertain .
