A 3-year clinical trial to compare efficacy of dentifrices containing 1.14% and 0.76% sodium monofluorophosphate.
A 3-yr daily supervised toothbrushing study with a double blind design was conducted to evaluate the anticaries effectiveness of a 1.14% sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP) dentifrice (1500 ppm F) compared to a 0.76% MFP dentifrice (1000 ppm F). This study began with nearly 4000 children, primarily aged 8-11, in grades 3-5, residing in a nonfluoridated community in Florida. A total of 2415 children completed 3 yr of the study, representing 61% of the children who began the study. The results indicate a statistically significant (P less than 0.001) anticaries benefit was derived over a 3-yr period from the use of the higher fluoride dentifrice (1500 ppm F) when compared to the positive control (1000 ppm F). Percent reductions in mean dental caries increments were 20.9%, 22.1%, 21.8%, 24.3%, and 35.2% for DMFT, DFT, DMFS, DFS, and DFS Interproximal, respectively.
