Short-term regular beta 2-adrenergic agonists treatment is safe in mild asthmatics taking low doses of inhaled steroids.
Regular treatment with beta 2-adrenergic agonists is controversial in bronchial asthma. To investigate whether beta 2-adrenergic agonists can be used safely if associated with low doses of inhaled steroids, for a short period, without a deterioration of asthma control, we have examined 24 mild asthmatics. In a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 1 week of run-in and run-out period framed 3 weeks of treatment. All patients received inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP 250 micrograms t.i.d.); after 1 week, 12 patients inhaled 400 micrograms of broxaterol and 12 patients received placebo t.i.d. FVC, FEV1, PD20-FEV1 methacholine, morning and evening PEF, and PEF amplitude % mean were measured before, during, and after treatment. No significant changes were noted in patients receiving inhaled broxaterol. There were no differences in symptoms and the use of rescue medication (salbutamol spray). We conclude that short-term regular treatment with beta 2-adrenergic agonists is not associated with a deterioration in asthma control in mild asthmatics inhaling low doses of steroids.
