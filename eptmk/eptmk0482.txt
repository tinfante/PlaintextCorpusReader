Efficacy of modern dressings in the treatment of leg ulcers: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared modern versus conventional dressings for leg ulcers and compared different types of modern dressings. The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine the most effective type of dressing. Overall, this was a well-conducted review and the authors' conclusion reflects the limited evidence from generally poor-quality studies.
