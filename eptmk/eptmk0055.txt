Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prostate cancer risk: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review of observational studies concluded that epidemiological evidence for a protective effect of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs against prostate cancer was suggestive but not conclusive. The review was generally well-conducted apart from the absence of a formal validity assessment. The cautious conclusion is probably reliable.
