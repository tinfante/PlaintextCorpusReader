Community-based nurse health coaching and its effect on fitness participation.
This article reports on the characteristics of the individuals participating in Health Matters, a community-based health promotion and fitness program for the elderly. A total of 255 persons were recruited into the program. Eligibility criteria included having one or more qualifying chronic health conditions, being 65 or older, having membership in a participating health plan, and ownership of a CalPERS long-term care insurance policy. The intervention included nurse health coaching, training in self-management of chronic illness, referrals to community resources, and a fitness program. More than 90% of participants were in exercise programs at 12 months, and 30% had participated in one or more condition management classes. Health Matters' senior-oriented fitness program was more successful in attracting higher disability risk members than were either community-based or self-exercise programs. Health Matters demonstrated that it is possible to proactively recruit and retain individuals in a health-promotion program. The nurse coaches/case managers communicated with primary care physicians about the enrollees and their health action plans, but recruitment did not rely on physician referrals.
