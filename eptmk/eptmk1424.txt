Statins and fracture risk: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that current evidence does not support the use of statins to prevent fractures. Although these conclusions appear to be well supported by the evidence presented, they require some caution in interpretation given the uncertainties and weaknesses in the review process, lack of prospective randomised evidence and differences between the primary studies.
