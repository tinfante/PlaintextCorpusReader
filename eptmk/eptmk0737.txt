A randomized double-blind prospective trial of two doses of gestrinone in the treatment of endometriosis.
The purpose of this randomized double blind prospective trial was to study the efficacy and safety of two doses of oral gestrinone in the treatment of endometriosis. Six patients received gestrinone 1.25 mg twice weekly (group I) and six patients received gestrinone 2.5 mg twice weekly (group II). Patients underwent pretreatment and post-treatment laparoscopies and their endometriosis scores were recorded. The mean total endometriosis scores declined significantly from 20.0 +/- 5.2 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) pretreatment to 9.5 +/- 3.9 post-treatment in group I and from 19.1 +/- 4.8 pretreatment to 7.1 +/- 2.1 post-treatment in group II. A total of 67% of patients reported side effects. This study suggests that oral gestrinone 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg twice weekly is efficacious and safe in the treatment of endometriosis.
