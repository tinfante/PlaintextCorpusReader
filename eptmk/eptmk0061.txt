Effect on Blood Pressure of Cesarean Section Patients in Different Postures
To probe into the affect of different postures on blood pressure and pulses of patients with cesarean section , 60 cases were randomly divided into 3 groups. Each group had 20 patients and they were in supine , left oblique , and right oblique position. Both blood pressure and pulses of the patients were observed before and 5 min, 10 min, 15 min after anesthesia respectively. Results showed that 15 min after anesthesia , both in supine and right oblique position groups , there were statistical differences between before and after anesthesia in terms of their blood pressure changes (P < 0.05) . In terms of pulse changes of the patients , there were no statistical differences between before and after anesthesia (P > 0.05) . Suggested that for cesarean section patients it is good to use left oblique position to relieve the pressure of enlarged womb on inferior vena cava. It is also a simple and easy way to prevent low blood pressure syndrome from happening for patients underwent cesarean section.
