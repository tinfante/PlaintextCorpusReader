Diagnostic accuracy of self collected vaginal specimens for human papillomavirus compared to clinician collected human papillomavirus specimens: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared the accuracy of self-collected vaginal specimens with clinician-collected samples for the detection of human papillomavirus. The authors concluded that self-collected specimens using Dacron swabs, cotton swabs, or cytobrushes have a combined sensitivity of over 70%. The limited search, limited quality assessment and variability of the study results weaken the robustness of these conclusions.
