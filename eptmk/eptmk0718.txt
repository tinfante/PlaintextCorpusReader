Combination endoscopic band ligation and sclerotherapy compared with endoscopic band ligation alone for the secondary prophylaxis of esophageal variceal hemorrhage: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that endoscopic band ligation (EBL) plus sclerotherapy is more effective than EBL alone in the secondary prevention of oesophageal variceal hemorrhage. Given that the findings were based on a small number of trials of poor quality, the authors' conclusions should be interpreted with some caution.
