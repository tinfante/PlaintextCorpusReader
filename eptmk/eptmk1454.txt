A multicentre prospective randomized trial comparing ceftazidime with cefazolin/tobramycin in the treatment of hospitalized patients with non-pneumococcal pneumonia.
A multicentre prospective randomized control trial was done to compare the efficacy and toxicity of ceftazidime with that of cefazolin/tobramycin in the treatment of hospitalized patients with non-pneumococcal pneumonia. The results for 50 patients are reported in this paper; 24 in the ceftazidime group and 26 in the cefazolin/tobramycin group. Measurements of clinical response show no differences between the two groups: the same is true for bacteriological response. Minimal toxicity was seen with both treatment groups. The results support the use of ceftazidime as single-drug treatment of hospitalized patients with pneumonia.
