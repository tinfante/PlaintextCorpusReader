Mandatory alcohol intervention for alcohol-abusing college students: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated intervention programmes for alcohol education or counselling for college or university students. The authors concluded that limited evidence suggests there are elements that improve outcomes but, in general, further research is required. Despite various potential sources of bias in the review process, the overall conclusion that further research is required is likely to be reliable.
