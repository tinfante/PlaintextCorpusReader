The use of a moulded metacarpal brace versus neighbour strapping for fractures of the little finger metacarpal neck.
Seventy-three patients with fractures of the neck of the little finger metacarpal were randomized to treatment with a moulded metacarpal brace or neighbour strapping. Sixty-five of these attended for follow-up at 3 weeks. Both treatment modalities permitted a functional range of movement, but patients treated with the metacarpal brace had significantly less pain than those treated with neighbour strapping, and this facilitated an early return to work.
