Adverse event profile of tramadol in recent clinical studies of chronic osteoarthritis pain
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the safety of long-acting formulations of tramadol hydrochloride in the treatment of chronic osteoarthritis pain and concluded that differences in formulations may influence rates of adverse events. However, these differences should be interpreted with caution. Potential bias in the review, heterogeneity among studies and their unclear quality, support the authors' recommendation to interpret the findings with caution.
