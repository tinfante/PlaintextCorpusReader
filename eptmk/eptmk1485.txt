Rehabilitation programs for individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome: a review
CRD SUMMARY: This poorly described review concluded that there is some evidence that both in- and out-patient rehabilitation programmes can improve a variety of outcomes for patients with chronic fatigue or chronic fatigue syndrome, but the current evidence is subject to a number of methodological flaws. Given the differences between the studies and the poor quality of the data, a cautious interpretation of the evidence is advised.
