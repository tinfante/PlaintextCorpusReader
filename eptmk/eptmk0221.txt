Female-condom use in a gender-specific family planning clinic trial.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated female-condom use among women participating in an HIV/STD intervention designed to reduce unprotected sex and expand prevention strategies. METHODS: Women (n = 360) were recruited from a family-planning clinic and were randomized into an 8- or 4-session intervention group or a control group. We conducted follow-up interviews at 1, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: At 1 month, the odds ratios of first-time female-condom use were 9.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.01, 22.20) in the 8-session group and 4.39 (95% CI = 1.84, 10.49) in the 4-session group relative to controls. Repeated use (n = 21) was predicted by perceived ability to use, by self and partner satisfaction, by dislike of male condoms, and by previous diaphragm use. CONCLUSIONS: Gender sensitive cognitive-behavioral interventions can influence women to try the female condom. To increase long-term use, interventions may need to include self-insertion practice and involvement of male partners.
