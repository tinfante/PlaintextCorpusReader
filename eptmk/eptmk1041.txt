Low birth weight babies: the mother's point of view.
Women's feelings and beliefs about low birth weight (LBW) were obtained by postal questionnaire completed postnatally by 467 women who had participated in a randomised controlled trial of social support in pregnancy. All the women in the study had previously given birth to a LBW baby. Differences were found between beliefs about causes of LBW in general and in the women's explanations for their own LBW baby. These ambiguities were particularly noticeable in relation to smoking beliefs. The women's views on medical care; the practical and emotional problems of low birth weight; and the solutions to some of those problems are discussed. The need for more support from health professionals was given top priority. The main needs of women with a 'high risk' pregnancy were more reassurance and information, recognition of the economic hardships that can be caused, and more attention to their feelings and opinions.
