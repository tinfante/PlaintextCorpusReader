Constraint-induced movement therapy following stroke: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effectiveness of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) to improve upper limb function and quality of life following stroke. The authors concluded that, compared with an alternative or no treatment, CIMT may improve upper limb function for some patients. The conclusion is suitably cautious given the very weak evidence identified.
