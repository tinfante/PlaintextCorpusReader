Use of a thromboembolic risk score to improve thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients.
Two hundred admissions to a general surgical ward were audited prospectively before and after the introduction of a thromboembolic risk score. This was based on the Thromboembolic Risk Factors (THRIFT) Consensus Group guidelines for thrombo-prophylaxis. The results showed an overall improvement in compliance from 65% to 79%. High risk patients formed 24% of the patients studied. In this group, compliance improved significantly from 14% to 58%. The overall prevalence of important thromboembolic risk factors was calculated. Of the patients, 26.5% had a Body Mass Index (BMI) of > 25, and 10% gave a past or family history of thromboembolism. Of female patients, 24% were taking oestrogens. We conclude that quantitative assessment of all patients for thromboembolic risk can improve the implementation of thromboprophylaxis, particularly in high risk patients.
