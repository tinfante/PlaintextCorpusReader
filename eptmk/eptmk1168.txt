Comparative study on the efficacy of Yiweining and Gestrinone for post-operational treatment of stage III endometriosis.
OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy and safety of Yiweining (YWN) and gestrinone (GT) in treating post-operational patients of stage III endometriosis (EM-III).
METHODS: Fifty-two patients of EM-III after operation were randomly assigned into three groups, the YWN group (20 patients) was treated through oral intake of YWN 200 ml, twice a day; the GT group (19 patients) treated with gestrinone 2.5 mg, twice every week, with the medication starting from the 7th post-operational day and lasting for 6 months. The control group (13 patients) was untreated. Six months was one therapeutic course, and follow-up study was carried out in the 6 - 30 months after the end of the medication.
RESULTS: The recurrence rate in the YWN group and the GT group were 5.0% and 5.3% respectively, showing insignificant difference between the two groups, but they were lower than that in the control group (30.7%, P < 0.05). Besides, the adverse reaction rate in the YWN group was lower than that in the GT group (10.0% vs 31.6%, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Application of YWN to prevent the post-operational recurrence of endometriosis is effective and safe, and its efficacy is similar to that of GT.
