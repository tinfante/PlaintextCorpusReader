The failure of conventional drug therapy in the management of infantile colic.
During five years, 97 young infants with colic were studied. One of us (J. C. O'D.) compared homatropine methylbromide plus phenobarbital in a 20% alcohol solution, and all of the individual components of that solution, to see which was most effective in the symptomatic relief of colic. Regardless of the child's age on entry into the study, conditions in no treatment group improved more rapidly than in those treated with a placebo.
