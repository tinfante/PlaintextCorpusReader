[Indomethacin in the prevention of subependymal-intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm newborns with conventional mechanical ventilation]
The results of a double blind study to evaluate the efficiency of prophylactic endovenous indomethacin versus placebo for prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in newborn infants between 28 to 36 weeks of age who were intubated at the delivery room and required mechanical ventilation in NICU are presented. Fourty six patients required mechanical ventilation, but 14 neonates had IVH evaluated by ultrasound when were admitted to the Unit. At least 32 infants were studied, 16 for each group. There were no differences between the groups in weight, gestational age, sex and delivery way. The mobility was the same in relation to hialine membrane disease, sepsis, pneumonie and pneumotorax. The placebo group had more frequency of PDA and mortality (P < 0.5). There were no differences in mean airway pressure and arterial gases, also in glucose, platelets and urinary volume. The indomethacin group had mayor urinary density and FeNa but the results were always in normal ranges. The IVH was the same in both groups. We concluded that the indomethacin at the levels used did not produced alterations, and if the IVH is not prevented, were observed lesser severity of the same and the frequency of PDA and mortality are lesser. But still is necessary more number of cases for best conclusions.
