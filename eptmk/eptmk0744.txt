Comparison of risk stratification with pharmacologic and exercise stress myocardial perfusion imaging: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared exercise and pharmacological stress myocardial perfusion imaging for risk stratification in known or suspected coronary disease. There were weaknesses in the review process and reporting of results. The conclusion that both tests have comparable risk stratification ability appears robust, but the greater risk of cardiac events for pharmacological stress test patients is not supported by the data presented.
