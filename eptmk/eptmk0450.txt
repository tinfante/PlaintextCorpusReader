Clinical and functional evaluation of the efficacy of otilonium bromide: a multicenter study in Italy.
Seventy-two patients complaining of abdominal pain were studied in a double blind trial with otilonium bromide (OB) (40 mg tid or placebo). In our patients we performed, before and after the treatment, a clinical evaluation (symptom variations) and functional studies (sigmoid manometry during bowel distension). As regards clinical parameters, otilonium bromide significantly reduced abdominal pain and bloating and significantly increased (p less than 0.02) the pain threshold. However the comparison with the placebo group did not show any difference between the two groups. Sigmoid motility during distension was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) in OB group, whereas it did not change in the placebo group. We can conclude that, in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients, OB is able to improve symptoms and to reduce stimulated motor activity of the sigmoid.
