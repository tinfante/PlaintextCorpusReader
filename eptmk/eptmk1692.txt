Usefulness of 4-, 8-, and 16-slice computed tomography for detection of graft occlusion or patency after coronary artery bypass grafting
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed computed tomographic angiography for the evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafts. The authors concluded that single-slice computed tomography (CT) can be used to detect graft patency but not occlusion, while 4- and 16-slice CT can be used for the detection of both occlusion and patency. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution given the limitations of the review, in particular the lack of any formal quality assessment.
