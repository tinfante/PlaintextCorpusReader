Gender differences at admission and follow-up in a sample of methadone maintenance clients.
Although one-third of clients enrolled in methadone treatment in the United States are female, few studies have looked at gender differences at admission and follow-up. Using interview data from 435 clients (31% female) collected at admission and approximately 1 year after discharge, females were found to have more dysfunctional families of origin and greater prior and current psychological and medical problems. Both genders improved following treatment, as evidenced by reduced illicit drug, tobacco, and alcohol use, criminal involvement, and HIV/AIDS-risky behaviors. Females were more likely to seek further help for both drug misuse and psychological problems subsequent to discharge.
