Randomized trial of cefotiam prophylaxis in the prevention of postoperative infectious morbidity after elective cesarean section.
A prospective, randomized study was performed in order to evaluate the effect of cefotiam in the prevention of postoperative infectious morbidity in patients undergoing low-risk elective cesarean section. A total of 146 patients were randomly assigned to receive either intraoperative single-shot prophylaxis with 2 g cefotiam (study group, n =76) or no prophylaxis (control group, n=70). Due to a higher rate of urinary tract infections, the incidence of infectious morbidity after cefotiam prophylaxis was higher in the study group than in the control group (16% vs. 9%, P=0.1). Postoperative infectious morbidity following low-risk elective cesarean section cannot be reduced by intraoperative cefotiam prophylaxis.
