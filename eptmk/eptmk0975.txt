Double-blind studies of the clinical effectiveness of prazosin.
In separate double-blind trials, prazosin was compared with placebo and with methyldopa and placebo. In both, prazosin was well tolerated and succeeded in lowering blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The mean reductions with methyldopa were greater, but the difference was not statistically significant and a higher percentage of the patients in the prazosin group became normotensive.
