Use of protein:creatinine ratio measurements on random urine samples for prediction of significant proteinuria: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the utility of the protein:creatinine ratio in a random urine sample to rule out proteinuria as defined by 24-hour urine protein measurement. The authors' conclusion that the protein:creatinine ratio can be used to rule out proteinuria was somewhat optimistic given the data presented. Limitations in the search strategy and methodology used in the review could also cast doubt upon its findings.
