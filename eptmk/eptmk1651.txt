The impact of cognitive-behavior therapy for anxiety disorders on concomitant sleep disturbances: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that available research on the impact of cognitive-behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders on concomitant sleep problems did not permit definitive conclusions. This seems to be an appropriate conclusion, but needs to be considered against some limitations of the review, such as a lack of quality assessment and the pooling of very varied data.
