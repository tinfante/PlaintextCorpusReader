Recombinant activated factor VII in cardiac surgery: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the efficacy and safety of human recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) in cardiac surgery. The authors suggested that rFVIIa may reduce refractory post-operative bleeding while limited evidence supports rFVIIa in a prophylactic role. These conclusions have to be interpreted with extreme caution as they are based on small poor-quality studies.
