Effect of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy on bone mineral density in premenopausal and perimenopausal women: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the effect of oral contraceptives on bone mineral density. The authors concluded that there is good evidence of a positive effect in perimenopausal women and fair evidence of a positive effect in hypothalamic oligo/amenorrhoeic premenopausal women. Poor reporting of review methods and reliance on a few small randomised controlled trials mean that these results should be interpreted with caution.
