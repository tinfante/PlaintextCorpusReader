Hyaluronic acid versus albumin in human embryo transfer medium.
We compared the implantation and pregnancy rate through in vitro fertilization (IVF) using hyaluronic acid and albumin as transfer medium in 60 women randomly allocated to 2 groups. In treatment group A (n = 30), embryos were transferred to medium supplemented with hyaluronic acid. In the control group B (n = 30), embryos were transferred to medium containing albumin. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of mean age of the females, mean duration of infertility and mean number of embryos. The pregnancy rate in groups A and B were 81.8% and 71.4% respectively, a non-statistically significant difference. Hyaluronic acid can successfully replace albumin as transfer medium.
