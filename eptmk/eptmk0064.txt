Pairs of "J" tube in extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy treatment of ureteral calculi
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the retention of the double "J" tube in the value of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for ureteral stones. METHOD: 76 cases of patients with ureteral stones ESWL before surgery were randomly divided into pairs of "J" pipe treatment group and control group to observe the relatively ESWL efficacy. RESULTS: double "J" pipe treatment group ESWL the number (P <0.05), mean expulsion time (P <0.01) significantly reduced and stones a crush rate increased significantly (P <0.05). The two groups were significant differences. CONCLUSION: In the ESWL treatment of ureteric stones, indwelling double "J" tube is more effective than ordinary gravel.
