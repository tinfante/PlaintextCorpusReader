A literature review of randomized controlled trials of the organization of care at the end of life
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that despite methodological flaws and limitations, randomised controlled trials of end-of-life (EOL) care suggest that home- or community-based interventions compare favourably with conventional hospital or medical care. The review findings are supported by the data provided, but the unclear review methodology and the poor quality of the review data suggest that they should be interpreted with caution.
