[Domiciliary care of pathological pregnancies by midwives. Comparative controlled study on 996 women (author's transl)]
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of domiciliary care of pathological pregnancies by midwives a comparative study was carried out on two groups of pregnant women, the one group being treated by this new method of caring fort them, the other by traditional care. There was random selection for the two groups. The results of this comparative controlled study show that when midwives care for these patients at home once a pathological condition has become established premature labour and admission to hospital is not avoided. A more preventive attitude developed. This implies that they intervene very early in pregnancy as soon as risk factors for pathological conditions appear without waiting for the pathological conditions themselves to develop.
