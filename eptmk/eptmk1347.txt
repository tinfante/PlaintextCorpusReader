The use of misoprostol for mid-trimester therapeutic termination of pregnancy.
Extra-amniotic prostaglandin F2alpha (PG F2alpha) is probably the most widely used medical method for mid-trimester termination of pregnancy. The method is highly effective but is financially costly, particularly for poor countries faced with restricted health budgets. The aim of this study was to establish whether misoprostol administered vaginally is as effective as PG F2alpha. Sixty-one patients were prospectively randomized to receive either misoprostol (n=30) vaginally, or PG F2alpha (n=31) extra-amniotically. The overall success rate was 83.6%. The success rates in the misoprostol and PG F2alpha groups were 83.3% and 83.8% respectively. There was no statistical difference in the groups in relation to side effects. In this carefully selected group of patients, misoprostol was as safe and effective as PG F2alpha in mid-trimester termination of pregnancy. In these days of financial constraints, misoprostol is the preferred method for mid-trimester termination of pregnancy.
