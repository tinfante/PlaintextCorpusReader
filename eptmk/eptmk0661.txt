Infantile colic. Follow-up at four years of age: still more "emotional".
This paper presents a follow-up at 4 y of formerly colicky infants and controls, with respect to behaviour, temperament, eating and sleeping habits, psychosomatic complaints, number of hospital stays, growth and "family climate". There were no differences between the two groups in most parameters studied. However, ex-colicky children displayed more negative emotions according to the temperament scale. There were also more negative moods during meals, and more reported stomach-ache. Although relationships regarding crying and mother-infant interaction remain extremely complex, the findings point toward a possible temperamental contribution to the pathogenesis of the infantile colic syndrome.
