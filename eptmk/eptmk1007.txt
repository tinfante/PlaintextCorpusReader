Low level laser treatment of tendinopathy: a systematic review with meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that low level laser treatment was potentially effective in treating tendinopathy using recommended doses, but overall evidence was inconclusive. Although the statistical synthesis of results was limited and there was a possibility of missing studies, other parts of the review were well-conducted and the authors' tentative conclusion seems justified.
