Comparison of endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography for the preoperative evaluation of pancreatic cancer: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that studies differed in their design, quality and results but, overall, endoscopic ultrasound is superior to computed tomography for the detection of pancreatic cancer, although the optimal method for staging and determination of resectability remains undetermined. The reliability of these conclusions is restricted by methodological limitations in the selection and synthesis of studies in the review.
