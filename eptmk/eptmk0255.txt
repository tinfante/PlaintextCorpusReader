Effect of preoperative skin infiltration with 0.5% bupivacaine on postoperative pain following cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.
Recent work suggests that preoperative skin infiltration with local anesthetic may lead to reduced postoperative pain. We have studied this in a randomised, prospective, double-blind trial of 40 women having cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. After establishment of the spinal block, the incision line was infiltrated in 20 women with 30 ml 0.5% bupivacaine and in 20 with 30 ml normal saline. There was no difference in pain scores between the 2 groups on any of the 3 postoperative days, perhaps due to the high quality analgesia provided by supplemental subarachnoid morphine.
