Prognostic value of the labour admission test and its effectiveness compared with auscultation only: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This well-conducted review assessed whether the labour admission test (cardiotocography) improves outcomes for the mother and child compared with auscultation only. There was no evidence that the labour admission test is beneficial in low-risk women and the test was found to be a poor predictor of adverse outcomes. The conclusions are likely to be reliable.
