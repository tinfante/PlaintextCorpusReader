Stimulating active coping in patients with rheumatic diseases: a systematic review of controlled group intervention studies
CRD SUMMARY: The review assessed the effects of coping interventions for people with rheumatic diseases. The authors concluded that limited positive effects on quality of life were found with group interventions teaching self-management skills or skills in dealing with pain and stress; further research was recommended. This was a well-conducted systematic review and the authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable.
