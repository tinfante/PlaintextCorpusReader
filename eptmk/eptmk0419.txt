Low-molecular-weight heparins in conjunction with thrombolysis for ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction: a critical review of the literature
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that subcutaneous administration of dalteparin, enoxaparin or reviparin in hospital, as an adjunct to various thrombolytics in ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction, appears feasible and at least as effective and safe as intravenous unfractionated heparin. Owing to shortcomings in the review methodology, the conclusions have to be regarded with caution.
