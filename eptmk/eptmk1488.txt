Rescue angioplasty or repeat fibrinolysis after failed fibrinolytic therapy for ST-segment myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis of randomized trials
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that rescue percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with improved clinical outcomes for ST-segment myocardial infarction patients after failed fibrinolytic therapy, but there are potential risks. No significant clinical improvements were shown for fibrinolytic therapy and it may be associated with increased harm. Overall, the conclusions appear reliable.
