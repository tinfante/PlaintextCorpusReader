Which patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease benefit from noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation: a systematic review of the literature
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The authors concluded that NPPV benefits patients with severe exacerbations, but studies found no benefit for milder exacerbations. The authors' conclusions about severe exacerbation are likely to be reliable, but there may have been insufficient evidence to show an effect for nonsevere exacerbations.
