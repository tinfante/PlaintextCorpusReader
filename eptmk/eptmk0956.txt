Three approaches to alcohol education.
An experimental examination of three approaches to alcohol education compared a cognitive program, a decision-making program and a values-clarification program. The cognitive program was most positively received and was superior in raising levels of knowledge; the values-clarification program was least effective, especially as measured by the program's impact on current and expected alcohol use.
