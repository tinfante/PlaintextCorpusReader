The compliance with antidepressants in general practice.
It has been known for some time that the compliance with antidepressants in general practice is sub-optimal, but no new studies have been carried out since the 1970s, since which time training in general practice has improved and new classes of antidepressants have been introduced. In this study 46 patients commenced on an antidepressant for clinical reasons by their GP were interviewed 10-12 weeks later by a research worker. Thirty two percent of patients stopped medication within 6 weeks and 63% of these did not inform their GP of their decision. Side-effect burden was significantly associated with non-compliance. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors showed a slight but non-significant compliance advantage in this small study but all patients treated with SSRIs were initially prescribed a dose for which there is evidence of superiority of effect over placebo, while only 30% of those on tricyclics were prescribed such a dose. Further work to establish accurate methods of determining compliance and effective ways of enhancing compliance with antidepressants in general practice is required.
