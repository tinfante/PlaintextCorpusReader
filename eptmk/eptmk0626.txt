Disulfiram implantation. A placebo-controlled trial with two-year follow-up.
Ten alcoholics implanted with disulfiram had longer periods of abstinence after treatment than did 10 alcoholics implanted with placebo; 7 of the disulfiram-implanted patients experienced a disulfiram-ethanol reaction in uncontrolled drinking situations, while none of the placebo-implanted patients did.
