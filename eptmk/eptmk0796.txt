Prevention of hypotension during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section.
Twenty-six parturients scheduled to receive spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section were randomized to receive either isotonic saline 750 ml plus 20 ml/kg (group A) or 750 ml plus 500 ml (group B) before subarachnoid administration of bupivacaine 13 mg. Ephedrine 0.15 mg/kg i.v. followed by an infusion 0.4 mg.kg(-1) h(-1) were then administered in group B. In both groups ephedrine 10 mg/min i.v. was given if the mean arterial blood pressure decreased more than 10 mmHg. Despite the fluid preload and large doses of ephedrine noted {median (range), group A 30 mg (10-80), group B 92 mg (25-194)}, hypotension, sometimes accompanied by nausea, still occurred. Mean maternal arterial was significantly lower in group A than in group B 5-10 min after induction of spinal anaesthesia (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the frequency of nausea or vomiting, Apgar score, or pH in umbilical cord blood. One neonate in group A and 2 in group B were acidotic. In conclusion, a reduced volume loading could be compensated with an increased ephedrine administration after induction of spinal anaesthesia, without increasing the incidence of hypotension or other maternal or neonatal complications. However, the fluid volumes and/or ephedrine doses used were not sufficient to prevent hypotension altogether.
