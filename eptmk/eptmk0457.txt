Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in postoperative pain management: current evidence and future directions
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the use of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors for pain following surgery. In terms of pain reduction and side-effects, the authors concluded that COX-2 inhibitors are similar to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The review does not give enough information to enable a confident judgement about how reliable or generalisable the conclusion is.
