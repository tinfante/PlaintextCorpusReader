Long-term skeletal changes with rapid maxillary expansion: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effects of rapid maxillary expansion on long-term transverse, anteroposterior and vertical skeletal changes. The authors concluded that evidence was limited and further research is required. The review was limited by poor reporting of the review methods and study details but, overall, conclusions about the limitations of the evidence and need for further research seem appropriate.
