Geriatric consultation teams in acute hospitals: impact on back-up of elderly patients.
Back-up of elderly patients in hospital awaiting long-term placement has become a major problem in some areas of the United States and elsewhere. In 1982, geriatric consultation teams (physician, nurse, and social worker) were introduced into six acute hospitals in Monroe County, New York, to help alleviate the problem through more attention to restoration of patient function and comprehensive discharge planning. Over a six-month period, 4,328 newly hospitalized patients aged 70 or older were screened, and geriatric consultations were provided for 366 (8.5 per cent) who were judged to be at risk of requiring prolonged hospital stays. During this period, the mean monthly census of elderly patients backed up in hospital declined 21 per cent, a reversal of previous rises that could not be explained by any other identifiable factors. The impact was on length of stay on back-up status rather than rate of entry to that status. A variety of medical, rehabilitative, and social interventions accounted for this outcome. A number of health care system barriers to expeditious rehabilitation and discharge of hospitalized elderly patients were identified. Geriatric consultation was deemed useful for implementation in acute hospitals in other settings.
