Treatment for diabetic nephropathy with integrated liposomal prostaglandin E1 and fosinopril.
OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of integrated liposomal prostagladin E 1 (Lipo PGE 1) and fosinopril on early diabetic nephropathy (DN) and clinical DN. METHODS: 86 patients of type 2 diabetic patients with DN were randomly divided into control group (fosinopril) and treated group (fosinopril + Lipo PGE 1). UARE, Scr and BUN figures were compared between two groups before treatment and eight weeks after treatment. RESULTS: UAER had been decreased significantly in both groups (P 0.05, P 0.01), and more significantly in treated group than in control group (P 0.05). Scr had been decreased significantly in treated group (P0.01), while no significant decrease of Scr had been found in control group during the follow-up (P 0.05). Furthermore, no significant decrease of BUN, FBG, MPA, TC and TG had been found in both groups. CONCLUSION: Integrated Lipo PGE 1 and fosinopril can ameliorate proteinuria and improve renal function of the patients with early DN and clinical DN of normal renal function.
