Antibody responses determined for Japanese dengue fever patients by neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition assays demonstrate cross-reactivity between dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses.
Titers of antibodies to infecting dengue virus serotypes determined by serum neutralization assay were higher than those of antibody to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus in Japanese dengue patients after disease day 8. Titers of antibody to dengue virus antigens determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay were higher in only 1 of 23 serum specimens after disease day 11. Thus, the neutralization test is more reliable than the HI test for serological diagnosis of dengue in countries where JE vaccination is widely used or JE is endemic.
