[Flunarizine and dihydroergotamine in the treatment of migraine in children].
We administer during 6 months in randomised way dihydroergotamine or flunarizine to 50 children affects of classical or common migraine. A significative improvement was estimated in frequency, intensity and duration of their crisis in 87% with dihydroergotamine and 79% with flunarizine, without significative differences from one to other. Dihydroergotamine was specially effective in children with vegetative lability. The secondary effects, 12% with dihydroergotamine and 20% with flunarizine, were trivial and advantageous even, without the necessity of stop the treatment in not any case.
