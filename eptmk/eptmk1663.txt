Efficacy of antibiotic-impregnated external ventricular drain catheters.
We prospectively compared the incidence of ventriculitis associated with external ventricular drains (EVD) impregnated with clindamycin and rifampicin with historical controls. We found the use of antibiotic impregnated (AI) EVDs showed a significant decrease in positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures and a significant delay in time to EVD infection.
