[Subcutaneous injections and intravenous infusion of sodium salt of heparin in the treatment of thrombosis of deep veins of the lower extremities]
Ninety-four patients with deep vein thrombosis of inferior limbs were randomly allocated to receive sodium heparin either by subcutaneous injections or by continuous intravenous infusion for six days. No significant difference was observed in the therapeutic efficiency as judged by phlebographic examinations and in rate of symptomatic pulmonary embolism between the two groups. There was one instance of major bleeding in the subcutaneous group. Minor bleedings occurred in 10 of the 48 patients treated with subcutaneous heparin and in 13 of the 46 patients receiving intravenous heparin. The results showed that subcutaneous injections of sodium heparin are as effective and safe as continuous intravenous infusion of this drug in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.
