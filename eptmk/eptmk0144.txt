The pain-relieving effect of electro-acupuncture and conventional medical analgesic methods during oocyte retrieval: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed pain relief from acupuncture and other conscious sedation methods used in assisted reproduction therapy. The author concluded that no method was found to be superior for pain relief during oocyte removal, and clinical pregnancy rates appeared similar between interventions. Limitations in the search and study selection process may have introduced bias into the review.
