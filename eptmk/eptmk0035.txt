A study of delta intrauterine devices in Ankara, Turkey.
Delta devices, modifications of standard Lippes Loop D and TCu 220C IUDs, were designed for postpartum insertion. A study of the Delta T and the Delta Loop was conducted at Hacettepe University School of Medicine in Ankara, Turkey. The IUDs were randomly allocated to 246 immediately postpartum women (less than 10 min postplacenta). Twelve-month expulsion rates were low for both devices; 3.7 for Delta Loop users and 7.6 for Delta T users.
