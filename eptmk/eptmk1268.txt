Does vancomycin prescribing intervention affect vancomycin-resistant enterococcus infection and colonization in hospitals: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that it is unclear whether restricting vancomycin use is effective in reducing vancomycin-resistant enterococcus colonisation and infection in U.S. hospitals. Although the search was somewhat restricted and more steps could have been taken to minimise the risk of bias during the review process, given the apparent lack of well-designed studies these cautious conclusions appear justified.
