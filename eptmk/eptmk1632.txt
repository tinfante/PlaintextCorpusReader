[Primary curative incision in the treatment of perianorectal abscess]
More than 50% of the patients with perianorectal abscess treated with traditional incisional drainage will lead to fistula formation postoperatively. We present a procedure of primary curative incision for treatment with perianorectal abscess without fistula formation. The result of primary curative incision in comparison with traditional incisional drainage in a randomized control study showed that the incidence of postoperative fistula formation and recurrent abscess was 2.56% in the former and 56.25% in the latter. The key points of the procedure were discussed in detail and the causes and prevention of the disease occurred after injection of sclerotic drugs for hemorrhoids were also discussed.
