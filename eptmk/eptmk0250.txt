Systematic review: hepatotoxic events associated with herbal medicinal products
CRD SUMMARY: This review found some evidence that some herbal medicine products are associated with serious hepatotoxicity (liver damage). The authors stated that the incidence of events is generally unknown, and in most cases it could not be established that the herbal medicine caused the hepatotoxicity. The evidence presented appears to support the authors' conclusions.
