Revascularisation for acute coronary syndromes in older people
CRD SUMMARY: This review investigated percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) in people aged over 75 with acute coronary syndromes (mainly unstable angina). It concluded that CABG carries a high risk of mortality or complications while PCI is associated with lower risks. The conclusions appear appropriately cautious given that the results were derived from retrospective cohort studies.
