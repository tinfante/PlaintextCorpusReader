The efficacy and safety of auranofin compared to placebo in rheumatoid arthritis.
This double-blind multicenter study compares the effect of adding auranofin (AF) 3 mg bid or placebo to patients already taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for rheumatoid arthritis. The 242 patients who completed 3 months of therapy demonstrated that the group receiving AF responded better than those receiving placebo. Of the 144 patients who completed 6 months coded medication, the efficacy in the AF group was superior to the placebo group in several parameters including a reduction in the number of painful or swollen joints, grip strength, dropout rate, and global efficacy as judged by the evaluating physician. A significant lowering of the Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate and immunoglobulin levels was noted in the AF treated patients. This study includes data summarizing the difference between both groups with respect to on-therapy conditions and toxicity.
