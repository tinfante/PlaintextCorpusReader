Meta-analysis: angiotensin-receptor blockers in chronic heart failure and high-risk acute myocardial infarction
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the efficacy of angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with chronic heart failure and high-risk acute myocardial infarction. The authors concluded that there was no difference between ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure. The review was relatively well-conducted, although the authors did not consider differences in the dosages evaluated across the included studies.
