Device selection and outcomes of aerosol therapy: evidence-based guidelines
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the efficacy and safety of nebulisers, pressurised metered-dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers as delivery systems for beta-agonists, anticholinergic agents and corticosteroids. The authors concluded that the delivery devices can be equally effective. Given the risk of studies being underpowered and the limited consideration of quality, the robustness of the authors' conclusions is somewhat unclear.
