[Standardized laparoscopic hernioplasty vs. Shouldice repair. Results of a randomized comparative study].
From 5/93 up to 12/93 a prospective randomized trial was performed. 102 patients with unilateral primary inguinal hernias were included. In 48 patients a Shouldice repair and in 54 patients a laparoscopic TAPP procedure was performed. The laparoscopic method is described. There were significantly less pain and quicker mobility in the laparoscopic group. In addition a shorter period of disability of work was seen (21 vs. 38 days) in the same group. The morbidity of the procedures was as low in the Shouldice as in the laparoscopic group. There was a regular control of all patients. The current follow-up period is 16 months (13-21) in median. In both groups there were no recurrences up to now. The efficiency of laparoscopic hernia repair is discussed.
