A comparative study of benzydamine hydrochloride ("Difflam" pump spray) and placebo as analgesics following tonsillectomy.
The use of benzydamine hydrochloride pump spray as a post-operative analgesic in children undergoing tonsillectomy was assessed in a double-blind trial in 56 subjects of ages ranging from 4-11 years. The raw tonsil bed was sprayed before the childrens' mealtimes and the appraisal of post-operative pain was made on the soreness of the throat as assessed by child, parent and surgeon; also assessed were the degree of referred earache, the ability of the child to swallow without discomfort, and the macroscopic appearance of the healing tonsillar bed. Results showed that the benzydamine spray was more effective than placebo in the control of post-operative pain.
