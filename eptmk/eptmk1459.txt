The need for anticoagulation following inferior vena cava filter placement: systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that an inferior vena cava filter can be placed in patients who cannot receive concomitant anticoagulation without placing them at significantly higher risk of venous thromboembolism. Potentially high risks of bias in the included studies and the variability between studies mean that the review findings may not be robust; therefore, the conclusions should be treated with caution.
