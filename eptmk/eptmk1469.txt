Routine hospital admission in twin pregnancy between 26 and 30 weeks' gestation.
Of 141 women with twin pregnancies, 72 were randomly assigned to outpatient care and 69 to hospital admission between 26 and 30 weeks' gestation. There were no differences between the groups in the frequencies of major maternal complications in pregnancy and labour but more of those admitted to hospital than of the outpatient group had to be admitted after 30 weeks. There were no differences between the groups in the mean birthweights of the twins by birth order, or in their mean gestation at birth whether analysed by intention to treat or by the treatment given. 22 infants were delivered before 32 weeks' gestation in the inpatient group compared with 10 in the outpatient group. With the exception of small-for-dates infants, any trend towards greater morbidity or mortality was seen in the inpatient group. The policy of routine hospital admission of women with twin pregnancies from 26 weeks' gestation is not beneficial to mother or babies and should be abandoned.
