Protecting children from environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure: a critical review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed interventions aimed at reducing residential environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in youths. The authors concluded that interventions can reduce children's exposure to ETS. The lack of a quality assessment, the unknown validity of methods used to assess outcomes, and the inconsistent results among studies mean that the conclusions may not be reliable.
