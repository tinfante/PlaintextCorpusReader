A comparison of traditional digital blocks and single subcutaneous palmar injection blocks at the base of the finger and a meta-analysis of the digital block trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated digital block techniques for treating finger injuries. The authors concluded that traditional digital blocks and single subcutaneous palmar injection blocks produce similar injection pain, and are less painful than the transthecal digital block. Palmar techniques are associated with incomplete anaesthesia. Given the small number of variable and poor-quality studies, the reliability of the authors' conclusions is unclear.
