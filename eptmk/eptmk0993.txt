Use of methylene blue in sepsis: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that methylene blue increases vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure in patients with septic shock, but the effects on mortality and oxygen delivery are unknown and further research is required. In view of the limited evidence, incomplete reporting of review methods and lack of a study quality assessment, it is not possible to confirm the reliability of these conclusions.
