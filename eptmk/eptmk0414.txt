Doripenem monohydrate, a broad-spectrum carbapenen antibiotic
CRD SUMMARY: Doripenem appeared to be non-inferior in Phase III trials to meropenem for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections, levofloxacin for urinary tract infections, and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam for nosocomial pneumonia. However, the reliability of the review methods and data were unclear, so the authors' findings may not be valid and should be interpreted with caution.
