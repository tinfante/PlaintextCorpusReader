Adenoidectomy for otitis media with mucoid effusion.
This random controlled study was undertaken to determine the extent to which nonsurgical treatment can control otitis media with effusion (OME); and if surgical treatment is indicated, and myringotomy, removal of middle ear liquid with insertion of aeration tubes is carried out, and whether removal of the adenoids produces any beneficial effect. A preparatory two-month nonsurgical treatment consisting of measures to improve the functional state of the nose was undertaken to eliminate from the study those children (42%) who would respond to medical treatment alone. The cure rate was similar in each of the operation groups with a greater relapse rate in the nonadenoidectomy groups who required 9% more aeration tube insertions. An estimation from x-rays of the size of the adenoids, shows that the group cured without surgery has a tendency towards the smaller adneoids. The relapse rate in the nonadenoidectomy group was independent of the size of the adenoids, and the study failed to show that any benefit accrued though adenoidectomy. Accordingly, the removal of adenoids should cease to be indicated in cases of OME as a primary form of treatment.
