Assessment of the use of bladder washouts/instillations in patients with long-term indwelling catheters.
A randomised cross-over study of 3 bladder washout treatments--saline, Suby G and Solution R--was conducted on 25 elderly females with long-term catheters in order to examine crystal formation and catheter encrustation. With 2 exceptions, all patients produced crystals; only 14 completed the study. While a significant reduction in struvite crystals was found in the returned acidic washout fluid, there was no significant reduction of crystals in the neutral (saline) washout following any of the 3-week periods of treatment. Uric acid crystals appeared with Suby G and Solution R and these solutions were associated with higher red cell deposits in the urine. There was no significant difference in catheter encrustation between the various washouts.
