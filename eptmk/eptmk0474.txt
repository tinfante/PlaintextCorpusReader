Educating patients about anesthesia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of media-based interventions
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated media-based patient education about anaesthesia prior to surgery. The authors concluded that videos and printed information on the process and risks of anaesthesia increased knowledge and reduced anxiety, but had no effect on patient satisfaction. This was a well-conducted review but, owing to insufficient information about the patients studied, it is difficult to determine in whom the intervention is effective.
