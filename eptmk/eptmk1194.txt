Cholesterol-lowering effect of stanol ester in a US population of mildly hypercholesterolemic men and women: a randomized controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of stanol esters in lowering cholesterol in a US population.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After a run-in phase, 318 subjects were randomized to receive one of the following margarine-like spreads containing stanol ester or placebo for 8 weeks: EU 3 G: 1 g of stanol (ester form) per 8-g serving of a European formula 3 times a day; US 3 G: 1 g of stanol (ester form) per 8-g serving of a US reformulation 3 times a day; US 2 G: 0.67 g of stanol (ester form) per 8-g serving of a US reformulation 3 times a day; or placebo spread.
RESULTS: Mean +/- SD baseline total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were 233+/-20 and 153+21 mg+/-dL, respectively. In the US 3 G group, 3 g daily of stanol esters lowered TC and LDL-C levels by 6.4% and 10.1%, respectively. There was a dose-dependent response compared with 2 g daily (US 2 G). Triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were unchanged. The incidence of adverse effects was not different from placebo. Serum vitamin A and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not affected.
CONCLUSIONS: Stanol esters lowered TC and LDL-C levels in a mildly hypercholesterolemic US population without evidence of adverse effects. It may be a useful dietary adjunct to lower cholesterol.
