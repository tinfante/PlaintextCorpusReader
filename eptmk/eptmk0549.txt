Would offering rapid point-of-care testing or non-invasive methods improve uptake of HIV testing among high-risk genitourinary medicine clinic attendees? A patient perspective.
While most genitourinary (GU) medicine clinics achieve a high uptake for testing HIV in new patients, they may still miss testing those at highest risk. Point-of-care testing (POCT) and salivary samples are acceptable and feasible but have not yet been shown to increase uptake among high-risk patients (HRP). This study aimed to describe reasons why HRP decline HIV testing and whether offering POCT along with standard testing would increase the uptake of testing HIV in two London GU medicine clinics. Anonymous self-administered questionnaires were offered to all new and rebooked patients. Eight hundred and ninety-nine questionnaires were analysed of which 598 were HRP. Uptake of HIV testing was 77.1% among HRP and 65.8% among the rest. A total of 51.1% of HRP who declined HIV testing said they would be more likely to accept a POCT and 32.8% a salivary test. Introduction of rapid POCT for HIV would increase patient's choice and may increase the likelihood of HRP accepting an HIV test.
