The effects of hospitalization for bed rest on duration of gestation, fetal growth and neonatal morbidity in triplet pregnancy.
Nineteen women attending a special multiple pregnancy antenatal clinic with a triplet pregnancy were randomly allocated to either bed rest in hospital from 24 weeks gestation onwards until delivery, or to continue conventional outpatient management. Conclusions are limited by the trial size, but the study suggests that routine hospitalization for bed rest decreases the incidence of preterm delivery and light-for-gestational age infants and reduces the need for intensive neonatal care. Although still compatible with change variation, the observations, if confirmed in a larger randomized study, would have considerable implications for clinical practice. The policy needs further evaluation in a large multicentered collaborative study.
