Once-a-day highly active antiretroviral therapy: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The review assessed once-a-day highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The authors concluded that some once-a-day HAART regimens had a virological efficacy at least similar to that of conventional HAART, an overall CD4 cell increase of at least 114 lymphocytes/microlitre, and good tolerability. The conclusions of this well-conducted systematic review are supported by the evidence presented.
