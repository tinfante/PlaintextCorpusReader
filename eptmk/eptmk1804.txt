Combined effects of a fluoride dentifrice and mouthrinse on the incidence of dental caries.
751 14- and 15-year old children completed a 3-year, double-blind, caries preventive program. The effects of daily, supervised toothbrushing with an 0.76% sodium monofluorophosphate dentifrice, rinsing with a 0.05% sodium fluoride mouthrinse, and the combined effects of the two treatments were investigated. Both the dentifrice and mouthrinse reduced the incidence of dental caries, but their combined use at the same time had no greater effect than either used alone.
