Effect of patient education on medication compliance.
Noncompliance is a major contributing factor to therapeutic failure. Many complex variables hae been reported to interfere with patient compliance. Though there are exceptions, educational techniques have been shown to be of value. Patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia, and bipolar and unipolar affective disorders were separated into control and experimental groups and studied to determine the factors associated with poor compliance and the potential value of educational techniques. Following a course of lectures and data sheets, the "educated" patients tended to be more compliant on outpatient follow-up. They were also less fearful of side effects and addiction. Factors associated with poor compliance were related to severity of illness, social isolation, fear of dependency and side effects (extra-pyramidal).
