Eosinophilic esophagitis in adults: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed eosinophilic oesophagitis, including the efficacy of five different therapies, in adults. The authors reported that one trial with corticosteroids before bougienage may reduce active inflammation and the complication rate. However, the authors' findings should be not be relied upon, as this was a very poorly reported review that included a large number of very small, poor-quality studies.
