Evaluation of an acute pain service.
During the last two decades, knowledge has increased significantly regarding the treatment of acute pain. One of these advances has been the implementation of multidisciplinary Acute Pain Services in the hospital setting to take on accountability for acute pain management. Acute Pain Services are expanding rapidly in the Canadian health care system. Nurse administrators will be increasingly called upon to help with the establishment and evaluation of these programs. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of, and staff satisfaction with, one Canadian Acute Pain Service. Results of the study indicated that staff were generally satisfied with the Acute Pain Service and felt that the program had made a significant impact on the treatment of acute pain within the hospital; although improvements in pain outcomes were not noted. Adequate communication mechanisms and resources to allow for appropriate workload, education and clinical support are critical to the development and success of an Acute Pain Service.
