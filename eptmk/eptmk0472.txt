Drug therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the efficacy and safety of treatments for recently diagnosed chronic myeloid leukaemia. The authors concluded that interferon plus cytarabine is most effective for prolonging survival but has more adverse effects than other options. The review had methodological limitations and was based on a limited number of disparate trials, so the conclusions should be treated with caution.
