Does garlic alter the lipid pattern in normal volunteers?
Clinical trials have shown that garlic can reduce elevated blood cholesterol levels. No information, however, exist on its effects on normal lipid patterns. Therefore a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the effects on blood lipids of 15 weeks' medication of garlic (600 mg dried garlic powder per day, Kwai, Lichtwer Pharma Berlin, standardised on 1.3% allicin) in 68 normal volunteers. During a two week "wash-out" period all measurements were stable. There was a significant drop (from 223 to 214mg/dl) in total cholesterol after 10 weeks' medication, triglycerides decreased numerically (from 124 to 118mg/dl) without reaching the level of significance. Blood pressure remained constant throughout. No changes occurred in the placebo group. It is concluded that the medication of garlic induces changes in blood lipids, even if these variables had been normal to start with.
