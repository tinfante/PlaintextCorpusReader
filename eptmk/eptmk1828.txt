Prevention of postoperative infection in cesarean section after rupture of the membranes.
Patients having a cesarean section more than 6 h after rupture of the membranes constitute a high risk group for postoperative infections. Two such groups were studied. Patients were given either cefuroxime 1.5 g every 8th hour for 24 h followed by cefadroxil 0.5 g twice daily for 6 days or received no medication. The infection rate was significantly reduced in the treatment group as compared to the control group (15% vs. 48%). Non-infected patients had a significantly shorter stay in hospital (8 days vs. 12 days). Combined use of these drugs for prevention of post-cesarean infection has not previously been reported. No side effects of the antibiotic prophylaxis were reported.
