Meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcomes trials comparing intensive versus moderate statin therapy
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that intensive statin treatment offers greater benefits than standard-dose treatment, mainly for nonfatal cardiovascular events. The review appears to support the authors' conclusions, but the poor reporting of review methods and the lack of an assessment of study quality mean that the reliability of the conclusions is uncertain.
