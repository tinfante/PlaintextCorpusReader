Lung-protective mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes in patients not suffering from acute lung injury: a review of clinical studies
CRD SUMMARY: This review investigated the effects of mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes on ventilator-associated lung injury in patients without acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The author concluded that the use of lower tidal volumes was associated with a reduction in ventilator-associated lung injury, but inconsistent results were also found in some studies. Without further details on study quality and given the other methodological concerns in the review process, the author's conclusions may not be reliable.
