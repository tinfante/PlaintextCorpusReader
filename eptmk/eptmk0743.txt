Comparison of late night and early morning removal of short-term urethral catheters
CRD SUMMARY: The review evaluated whether the timing of the removal of indwelling urethral catheters (IUCs) influences patient outcomes. The authors concluded that the limited available evidence suggested benefit, in terms of patient outcomes and a reduction in the length of hospitalisation, following the midnight removal of IUCs. The conclusion pertaining to the length of hospitalisation is reliable, but the generalised advantage of midnight removal of IUCs for patient outcomes is less clear.
