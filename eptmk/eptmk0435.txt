Field trial of inactivated oral cholera vaccines in Bangladesh: results from 5 years of follow-up.
To determine the protective efficacy (PE) of three doses of oral B subunit-killed whole cell (BS-WC) or killed whole cell-only (WC) vaccines against cholera, a clinical trial was conducted among 62285 children over 2 years and adult women in rural Bangladesh. During 5 years of follow-up, there were 144 cases of cholera in the BS-WC group (PE = 49%; P < 0.001), 150 in the WC group (PE = 47%; P < 0.001), and 283 in the K12 group. Protection by each vaccine was evident only during the first three years of follow-up; long-term protection of young children was observed only against classical but not El Tor cholera; 3-year protection against both cholera biotypes occurred among older persons, but at a higher level against classical cholera.
