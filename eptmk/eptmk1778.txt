Failure of ursodeoxycholic acid to prevent acute cellular rejection after liver transplantation.
BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acute rejection is still a major problem after liver transplantation. Ursodeoxycholic acid has beneficial effects in cholestasis by reducing the expression of major histocompatibility complex antigens. METHODS: We have performed a double-blind randomised study comparing ursodeoxycholic acid with placebo for the prevention of acute cellular rejection after liver transplantation. Twenty-six patients received ursodeoxycholic acid 600 mg per day and 24 patients received placebo for 2 months. RESULTS: Neither rejection incidence nor rejection severity was significantly different in the two groups (p > 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that adjuvant ursodeoxycholic acid administration does not prevent rejection after liver transplantation.
