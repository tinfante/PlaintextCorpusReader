Reduction of alcohol consumption by brief alcohol intervention in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review investigated the efficacy of brief alcohol interventions (BAIs) for the reduction of alcohol consumption in patients attending primary care. The authors concluded that BAIs can be effective in reducing alcohol consumption, and their effects can last for 48 months. This was a relatively well-conducted review, and it is likely that the authors' conclusions are reliable.
