An evaluation of the efficacy of postoperative blood salvage after total joint arthroplasty. A prospective randomized trial.
The efficacy of a postoperative blood salvage system was assessed in 239 consecutive patients undergoing total knee or total hip arthroplasty. Patients were randomly allocated to either a control group using a standard drainage system or to the study group using the Solcotrans blood salvage canister. The median amount of homologous blood required after operation by the study group was reduced by 74% from the amount required by the control group (mean, 67 ml vs 256 ml, respectively; P less than .0001). Thirteen percent (13%) of the study group required postoperative homologous blood transfusions, as compared to 39% of the control group (P less than .0001). Additionally, patients in the study group had higher hemoglobin levels beginning on the first postoperative day. This study indicates that a postoperative blood salvage system safely and effectively reduces the amount of homologous blood required and sustains higher hemoglobin levels after operation.
