Use of intravenous tranexamic acid to reduce allogeneic blood transfusion in total hip and knee arthroplasty: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared intravenous tranexamic acid with placebo for reducing blood loss in total hip and knee arthroplasty. The authors concluded that intravenous tranexamic acid reduces blood loss and the need for transfusion without increasing the risk of complications. Differences between the included studies may mean that the results of the review are not reliable.
