Tolerability, efficacy, and safety of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in combination with carboplatin versus gemcitabine-carboplatin for the treatment of platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in combination with carboplatin therapy was a rational alternative to gemcitabine-carboplatin for treatment of patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. These conclusions should be interpreted with caution due to the limited methodological rigour of the included studies, some concerns in the review methods and the possibility of publication bias.
