Effectiveness of case management for community elderly with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia in Taiwan: a record review.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the effectiveness of case management for community elderly with hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia (HC) (the so-called three highs).
DESIGN AND SETTING: Secondary data of the first and 3-month-after visiting records were extracted from 33 Public Health Centers in Taiwan.
PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred and sixty-six clients were selected who were at least 65 years old and had been diagnosed twice on the Case Management Record with at least one of the three highs.
RESULTS: This sample had a mean age of 72.6 years, 59.7% were female. Approximately 74% of the clients had HT, 55% had diabetes, and 15% had HC. Each elderly revealed 1.4 highs of the three highs. The elderly with HT, and diabetes, their blood pressures (BP) and blood sugars significantly decreased after being managed by public health nurses. Males and the elderly living in urban areas had more decrease in systolic BP. Females had more decrease in fasting blood sugar.
CONCLUSIONS: The study found that the case management of the three highs presented effectiveness on reducing the values of the three highs of the elderly in community.
