[Acute pulmonary embolism--are vena cava interruption procedures and extracorporeal circulation always necessary?]
Between 1983 und 1991, emergency pulmonary embolectomy with the aid of extracorporeal circulation was performed in 13 patients. Ten patients were in class IV according to Greenfield, seven came into the operating theater with external cardiac massage. The 30-day mortality was 46%. In the same period, 15 venous interruption procedures were performed (three Adams de Weese Clip, ten Greenfield-Filter, and two femoral vein ligations). Eight times the venous interruption procedure was done prophylactically. The acute pulmonary embolism of class III and IV according to Greenfield is an indication for lytic therapy. We operate only if there is a contraindication to lytic therapy or if there is deterioration of the clinical state.
