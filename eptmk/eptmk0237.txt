Relation between soy-associated isoflavones and LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations in humans: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the substitution of soy-associated isoflavones for dairy and animal protein. The authors concluded that soy-associated isoflavones are not related to changes in low- or high-density lipoproteins. Given the limited search, lack of a quality assessment, and insufficient display of all relevant results, it is difficult to assess whether the authors' conclusions follow from the evidence presented.
