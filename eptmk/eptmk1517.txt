Risk of carotid blowout after reirradiation of the head and neck: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The review concluded that carotid blowout is an infrequent but serious complication of re-irradiation for head and neck cancer and discussion of the risk should be undertaken for informed consent. Although there was potential bias in the review and no assessment of quality or clinical heterogeneity, the authors' cautious conclusions appear appropriate and are likely to be reliable.
