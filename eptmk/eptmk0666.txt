Surgical patient education: assessing the interventions and exploring the outcomes from experimental and quasiexperimental studies from 1990 to 2003
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed educational interventions for surgical patients. The authors concluded that there was some evidence of the effectiveness of educational interventions, but more research is required. The review was limited by the lack of duplication in the review process and the lack of a quality assessment. There was insufficient evidence to support the authors' conclusion regarding effectiveness.
