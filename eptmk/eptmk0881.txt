A randomized trial of weekly cardiotocography in high-risk obstetric patients.
A randomized clinical trial of once-weekly antenatal fetal heart rate monitoring in 539 high-risk patients could find no benefit of monitoring in terms of perinatal mortality, morbidity or Apgar score. The previously well-documented association between abnormal antenatal fetal heart rate traces and low Apgar score was confirmed. A detailed case review showed that in this population monitoring was irrelevant to almost all of the 13 perinatal deaths.
