[Progress in oral contraception. Advantages of a levonorgestrel-containing 3-stage preparation over low-dose levonorgestrel and desogestrel containing monophasic combination preparations].
The three-phase preparation, which contains levonorgestrel, has a number of advantages compared to the traditional monophase combination preparations. With the same contraceptive reliability its cycle stability is very much better than the monophase preparations, which are 40% high dosed in the progestin proportion (levonorgestrel and desogestrel). The dose relations of the new preparation agree with the most recent scientific knowledge on the metabolism aspects of hormonal contraceptives. The hormone dosage in the various phases of the menstrual cycle is largely adapted to the plasma level course of beta-oestradiol and progesterone in the corresponding phases of the normal cycle.
