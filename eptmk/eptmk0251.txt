Systematic review of adjuvant therapy for early stage (epithelial) ovarian cancer
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy following surgery for early ovarian cancer. The authors concluded there was no significant difference in survival between chemotherapy and radiotherapy and, that chemotherapy improved survival compared with no treatment. Toxicity and quality of life were not evaluated. Lack of assessment of the differences between included studies limits the strength of this review.
