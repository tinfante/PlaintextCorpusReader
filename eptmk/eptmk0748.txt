Complexity of program and clinical outcomes of heart failure disease management incorporating specialist nurse-led heart failure clinics: a meta-regression analysis
CRD SUMMARY: A meta-analysis to determine the benefits of specialist nurse-led heart failure (HF) interventions in comparison with usual care found that hospital usage and HF readmissions were lower in patients offered interventions that included discharge planning, but there was no effect on all-cause mortality and quality of life. The authors' conclusions appear optimistic given the evidence presented. There were several limitations in the review methodology which render the results potentially unreliable.
