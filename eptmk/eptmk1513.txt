Effect of high doses of human recombinant erythropoietin on the need for blood transfusions in preterm infants.
To determine whether prophylactic treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) and iron would reduce the need for blood transfusions, we randomly assigned 22 premature infants with gestational ages less than or equal to 32 weeks and birth weights less than or equal to 1.75 kg to receive rHuEPO, 400 IU/kg three times a week, plus iron, 20 mg/wk intravenously, from the second day of life (11 infants), or no rHuEPO and no iron (11 infants). The two groups had similar birth weights and clinical variables. The treated infants required fewer blood transfusions (0.8 +/- 1.5 vs 3.1 +/- 2.1; p = 0.01) and less volume of packed erythrocytes (14.2 +/- 25.9 vs 48.4 +/- 34.0 ml/kg; p = 0.02). The amounts of blood sampled were not different (19.5 +/- 21.1 vs 27.8 +/- 19.1 ml/kg; p = 0.35). Reticulocyte and hematocrit values were higher in the treated group (4.46% +/- 0.8% vs 1.49% +/- 1.1% (p = 0.0001) and 48.1% +/- 7.3% vs 43.8% +/- 4.7% (p = 0.004), respectively). No side effects of either rHuEPO or intravenously administered iron were noted. These data indicate that rHuEPO, in combination with iron supplementation, is effective in reducing the need for blood transfusions in the premature infant. More information is needed on dosage, timing, and iron and vitamin supplementation.
