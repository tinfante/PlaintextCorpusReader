Nutrition support in acute pancreatitis: a systematic review of the literature
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed nutritional support for patients with acute pancreatitis. The authors concluded that enteral nutrition improved outcomes compared with parenteral nutrition in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. The authors' conclusions appear to be supported by the evidence presented, but the inadequate reporting of study quality makes it difficult to assess the reliability of the results.
