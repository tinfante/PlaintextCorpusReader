Evaluation of the effect of immediate grafting of mandibular postextraction sockets with synthetic bone.
Immediate mandibular complete dentures were placed in 18 patients. To prevent ridge resorption, bone grafts with hard tissue replacement synthetic bone were placed in sockets on one side of the mandible. The untreated sockets on the contralateral side served as controls. Bone density as shown in panoramic radiographs was reported at the time of placement, at 5 months to 6 months postsurgery, at 12 months to 14 months postsurgery, and at 20 months to 24 months postsurgery. The sites treated with hard tissue replacement synthetic bone not only prevented ridge resorption but also showed increased optical (socket) density of regenerating bone in the initial phase of the study, and maintained that elevated level at 24 months postextraction.
