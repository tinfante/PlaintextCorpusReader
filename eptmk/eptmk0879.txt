Propranolol in prevention of rebleeding from oesophageal varices during the course of endoscopic sclerotherapy.
Thirty-one patients admitted with the first bleeding episode from oesophageal varices were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive oral propranolol, 160 mg daily, for 6 months (n = 15) or matching placebo (n = 16) for the same period. Endoscopy was performed each month during the 6 months and additionally after a further 3 months. The oesophageal varices were injected paravariceally with 2% aethoxysclerol until obliteration. If rebleeding occurred, additional sclerotherapy was performed. In the group treated with sclerotherapy and propranolol 3 patients rebled (20%; 95% confidence limits, 4%-48%), whereas 12 patients treated with sclerotherapy and placebo rebled (75%; 95% confidence limits, 48%-93%; p less than 0.05). There were no side effects to treatment in either of the groups, and it is concluded that administration of propranolol reduces the frequency of variceal rebleeding before variceal obliteration during a course of endoscopic sclerotherapy.
