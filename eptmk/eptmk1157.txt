The efficacy of a potassium-sparing combination of chlorthalidone and triamterene in the control of mild and moderate hypertension. II.
Chlorthalidone 50 mg/triamterene 50 mg in once-daily oral doses was as effective in reducing blood pressure as chlorthalidone 50 mg alone. The decrease in serum potassium was statistically significantly less with the combination than for chlorthalidone. There were no notable differences between the treatments in any other measure of laboratory safety or adverse reaction.
