Prevalence and pattern of major neurological disorders in rural Kashmir (India) in 1986.
In 1986 in the Kuthar Valley in the Anantnag District of south Kashmir (northwestern India), we studied the population to ascertain the prevalence and pattern of various neurological diseases. A house-to-house survey was done in a rural population of 63,645 (according to a World Health Organization protocol, 1981). 616 cases of major neurological disorders were detected, yielding a prevalence of ratio of 9.67/1,000 as of prevalence day November 1, 1986. The prevalence ratios for various common neurological disorders were: epilepsy 2.47/1,000; stroke 1.43/1,000; paralytic poliomyelitis 2.18/1,000; mental retardation 2.09/1,000; deaf mutism 1.63/1,000, and cerebral palsy 1.24/1,000. Persons with these conditions constituted 92% of all neurological cases. Patients with motor neuron disease, Alzheimer's dementia or multiple sclerosis were not found.
