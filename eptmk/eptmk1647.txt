Double Blind Trial of Yohimbine Hydrochloride in the Treatment of Erection Inadequacy
For many years yohimbine was a common treatment for disorders of potency and libido. However, yohimbine was withdrawn from use in the United Kingdom on account of inadequacy of the documentation confirming its efficiency. We report here the results of a double blind, cross over, placebo controlled trial of yohimbine hydrochloride 5.4 mg three times daily in the treatment of erectile inadequacy of mixed aetiology. Efficacy data are presented on 61 of 70 men recruited to the trial. Yohimbine was associated with a significant improvement in the quality of stimulated erections. The drug was generally well tolerated
