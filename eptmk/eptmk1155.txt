Thallium-201 exercise scintigraphy in patients having complete left bundle branch block with normal coronary arteries.
Eleven patients with left bundle branch block and chest pain suggestive of coronary arterial disease were analyzed using thallium-201 exercise scintigraphy, M-mode echocardiography and coronary arteriography. The coronary arteries were shown to be normal in all patients. A reversible anteroseptal defect on thallium-201 scintigraphy and an asynchronous septal motion on echocardiography were evident in eight patients. Thus, symptomatic patients with left bundle branch block may have reversible anteroseptal defects on thallium-201 scintigraphy which do not indicate coronary artery disease. Rather, they may be due to functional ischemia secondary to abnormal septal motion.
