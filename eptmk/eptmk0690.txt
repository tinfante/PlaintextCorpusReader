Misoprostol for treatment of early pregnancy failure in women with previous uterine surgery.
OBJECTIVE: Misoprostol use in early pregnancy may incur a risk of uterine rupture in women with previous uterine surgery. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 488 women who received misoprostol 800 microg vaginally in a study that evaluated medical and surgical management of early pregnancy failure. Subjects received a repeat misoprostol dose if expulsion was not confirmed 2 days after treatment. We compared efficacy, acceptability, and safety in subjects with a history (n = 78 women) or absence (n = 410 women) of uterine surgery, defined as cesarean delivery or myomectomy. RESULTS: Expulsion rates after a single misoprostol dose (69% vs 72%; P = .64) and overall success at 30 days (82% vs 85%; P = .50) were comparable. Pain, bleeding, complications, and acceptability did not differ. No uterine ruptures occurred (95% CI, 0, 3.8%). CONCLUSION: Misoprostol treatment for early pregnancy failure had similar success, acceptability, and complications in women with and without previous uterine surgery.
