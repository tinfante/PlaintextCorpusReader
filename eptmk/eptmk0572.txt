Comparison of oral ibuprofen and indomethacin on closure of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants.
Although intravenous indomethacin and ibuprofen are widely used for closure of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants, these formulations are unavailable in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In this study of the therapeutic effects of oral treatments, 20 preterm infants were randomized to oral ibuprofen (1 x 10 mg/kg, then 2 x 5 mg/kg at 24-hour intervals) or oral indomethacin (3 x 0.2 mg/kg at 24-hour intervals). Complete ductal closure was seen in 7/10 of the indomethacin and 8/10 of the ibuprofen group. The difference was not significant. There was no reopening after the ductal closure during the hospital stay or in the follow-up visits in either group and no excessive increases in the blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine levels were observed.
