Meta-analysis comparing drug-eluting stents with bare metal stents
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared the use of bare metal stents and drug-eluting stents (paclitaxel or sirolimus) for coronary artery stenosis. There was no difference in effect on mortality or overall myocardial infarction. The authors concluded that the treatments were similar and excluded, with confidence, the possibility of any clinically relevant differences. These conclusions are supported by the data presented.
