The effects of strength training on strength and health-related quality of life in older adult women.
The short-term effects of an accessible exercise intervention on the strength and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among older adult women were evaluated. We conducted an 8-week resistance training intervention utilizing elastic bands in 62 community-dwelling women with a mean age of 68 years. Participants were randomly assigned to either an exercise or a control group. Pre- and postintervention assessments included strength tests and HRQOL. Results revealed significant increases in three major muscles compared to the control group. However, there were no significant changes on either mental or physical health functioning. The elastic bands provide older adult women with an inexpensive, practical exercise program that effectively increases strength within 8 weeks but may have little effect on self-reported HRQOL.
