Short- and long-term effects of a pilot prevention program to reduce alcohol consumption.
This study examined the effects of a brief, pilot alcohol prevention intervention for 211 disadvantaged 6th grade school children at posttest and 1-year follow-up. Process data indicated that the intervention was successfully implemented and well received by youth and parent/guardian participants. ANCOVA analyses indicated a significant difference on alcohol use frequency for drinking subjects at 1-month posttest, with less frequent use reported by intervention subjects than subjects receiving the minimal control materials, F(1,22) = 5.37, p = .03. No differences were found between intervention and control subjects on alcohol use measures at 1-year follow-up. Critical issues to be resolved related to the success of future prevention research and practice are discussed.
