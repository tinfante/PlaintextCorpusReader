[Nurses' experiences with euthanasia in AIDS patients]
This article describes the experiences of nurses concerning the activities related to euthanasia of patients with aids. The nurses were employed in departments where relatively young, mature people wanted to arrange their own death. Our findings are based on six in-depth interviews with experienced nurses, that are part of a qualitative study into the experiences of nurses in taking leave of terminal patients with aids. The research strategy was based on the Grounded Theory. In order to analyse the experiences of the nurses, four phases were distinguished: set date and time unto application of lethal agent; application unto becoming unconscious; unconsciousness to death; death until transferring the body from the unit. Feelings that occur when taking leave of the patient, if not already taken care of at an earlier instant, play a major role in the phase from application to becoming unconscious. The fact that a deadly agent is being administered can generate feelings of guilt and anxiety. The period from unconsciousness to death is one of waiting. During this period nurses feel alienated and alone. The nurses indicated explicitly that an adequate preparation, evaluation and support are extremely important.
