Propranolol may prevent recurrence of oesophageal varices after obliteration by endoscopic sclerotherapy.
In 29 patients admitted with their first bleeding episode from oesophageal varices the varices were obliterated within 6 months by treatment with serial endoscopic sclerotherapy and propranolol or with sclerotherapy only. The patients were checked regularly during 18 months after the varices had been obliterated. Variceal recurrence was found in 11 patients (73%; 95% confidence limits, 45-92%) treated with sclerotherapy only and in 2 patients (15%; 95% confidence limits, 2-43%; p less than 0.01) treated with sclerotherapy and propranolol. In nine patients (69%) with recurrence significant variceal bleeding occurred. All recurrences were observed within 12 months after the initial obliteration. Variceal recurrence occurred in 3 Child A patients and in 10 Child B or C patients. All bleeding occurred in Child B or C patients. It is concluded that obliteration of oesophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy and propranolol may be more effective in the long-term control of variceal recurrence than treatment with sclerotherapy only.
