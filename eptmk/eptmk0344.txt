The number needed to treat for adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab based on ACR50 response in three randomized controlled trials on established rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared tumour necrosis factor-alpha blocking drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and concluded that adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab had similar efficacy, but infliximab may need higher doses for a similar effect. Given that this was based on an indirect comparison of only one trial of each drug and the authors highlighted a cautious interpretation, this conclusion may be overstated.
