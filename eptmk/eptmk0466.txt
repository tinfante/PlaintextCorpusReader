Diagnostic performance of intracardiac echogenic foci for Down syndrome: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the diagnostic performance of intracardiac echogenic foci, and evaluated whether they could be used in prenatal screening for trisomy 21. The authors concluded that the presence of these foci increases the risk of Down syndrome by five to seven times. However, since the quality of the primary studies was not assessed, these conclusions should be viewed with caution.
