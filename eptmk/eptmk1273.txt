Long-term risk of invasive cervical cancer after treatment of squamous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
CRD SUMMARY: This review determined the occurrence of invasive cancer after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and the rate of post-treatment CIN. The authors found a persistently high long-term risk of invasive cervical cancer after treatment for CIN, whereas the rate of post-treatment CIN showed a steady decrease over time. The review has some methodological weaknesses but the authors' cautious conclusions appear reliable.
