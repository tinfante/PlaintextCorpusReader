The costs and outcomes of multifaceted interventions designed to improve the care of congestive heart failure in the inpatient setting: a review of the literature
CRD SUMMARY: This review of interventions based on a team approach concluded that such interventions appear to be useful since there is little evidence to show that they are ineffective. The search was limited, review methods were not described and little information was given on the participants. Despite these methodological limitations, the authors' conclusions appear suitably conservative.
