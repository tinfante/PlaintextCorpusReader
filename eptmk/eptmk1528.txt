The effectiveness of glycosaminoglycans in peripheral vascular disease therapy: a clinical and experimental trial.
Thirty patients suffering from peripheral vascular disease (stage-II according to Fontaine) were included in a double-blind study aimed at assessing the efficacy of a high-dose glycosaminoglycan (GAG) (Sulodexide) both in terms of laboratory parameters, such as lipid metabolism and blood coagulation components, and instrumental procedures (strain-gauge plethysmography). Compared with the fifteen control patients (treated with placebo), the fifteen patients treated with Sulodexide showed a significant decrease in blood triglycerides and fibrinogen as well as a significantly increased HDL-cholesterol, and positive instrumental changes: at the end of treatment Peak and Rest Flow values--and consequently also Winsor's index--were significantly increased only in patients treated with Sulodexide.
