[Surgical treatment for acute massive pulmonary thromboembolism]
Acute massive pulmonary thromboembolism is a life threatening disorder that must be treated immediately. We performed emergent pulmonary thrombectomy using cardiopulmonary bypass on 15 patients. The patients were 7 men and 8 women aged 28 to 81 years. Early diagnosis was made by body CT scan and echocardiography. When patient had massive pulmonary thromboembolism, when hemodynamics could not be improved by medical treatment, direct embolectomy was performed immediately. 12 patients developed shock and 8 patients underwent cardiac massage. Among 15 patients, 11 were saved by surgical treatment, while the remaining 4 died of multiple organ failure, cardiac failure and mediastinitis. The lives of patients with acute massive pulmonary thromboembolism can be saved by early detection and emergent thrombectomy using cardiopulmonary bypass.
