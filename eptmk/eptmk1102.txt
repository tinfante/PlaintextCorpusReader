The pros and cons of videofluoroscopic assessment of swallowing in children
CRD SUMMARY: This review examined the evidence for using videofluoroscopy to assess impaired swallowing in children. The overall conclusion was that the evidence is limited and further research is required. The limited search strategy, poor reporting of review methodology, and lack of a quality assessment mean that the completeness and reliability of the evidence base identified are uncertain.
