Statins and risk of cancer: a systematic review and metaanalysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review found no association between statin therapy and the incidence of all cancers or site-specific cancers in the short term, independent of length of follow-up and type of statin. The authors' conclusions appear appropriate and are likely to be reliable. However, some studies with relevant data might have been missed.
