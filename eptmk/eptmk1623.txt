Effectiveness of Norplant implants through seven years: a large-scale study in China.
The effectiveness of Norplant implants over a seven year period of continuous use was studied in a multicenter trial. Pregnancy rates were 0.4 per 100 in both year six and year seven. More than 3,600 women completed 6 years and more than 2,400 women completed 7 years. Pregnancy rates increased with weight (p < .05) and decreased with age, but in years 6 and 7 combined, the pregnancy rate neither reached nor exceeded 1 per 100 woman years in any 5 year age group or in any 10 kg weight group.
