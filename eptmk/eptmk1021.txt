Use of a hydroxyapatite-coated hemiarthroplasty in the management of subcapital fractures of the femur.
A prospective clinical trial has been conducted comparing the use of a hydoxyapatite-coated bipolar hemiarthroplasty and an uncemented bipolar prosthesis in the treatment of displaced subcapital fractures of the femur. The trial was conducted over 1 year, 82 patients suffering displaced subcapital fractures of the femur were included. The patients were followed up for 1 year postoperatively. The functional result was significantly superior in the hydroxyapatite-coated group. Characteristic changes were found on radiographs both proximally and distally, indicating that distal stem fixation with proximal stress shielding had occurred.
