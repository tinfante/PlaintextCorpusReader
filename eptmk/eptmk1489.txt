Research review: can we justify the widespread dissemination of universal, school-based interventions for the prevention of depression among children and adolescents?
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that there is currently no consistent evidence that universal school-based programmes for the prevention of depression are effective in reducing depressive symptoms among children and adolescents in either the short or long term. Despite some limitations in the reporting of the review methods, overall, the review was well-conducted and these conclusions seem likely to be reliable.
