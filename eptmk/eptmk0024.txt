Whole plant cannabis extracts in the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that there was evidence that combined extracts of cannabis (delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol) may provide therapeutic benefit for spasticity symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis. In light of the good quality of the included trials, the authors' cautious conclusions appear to be appropriate, although the small number of trials should be borne in mind.
