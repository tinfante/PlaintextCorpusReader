Double-blind comparison of meclofenamate sodium with codeine and placebo for the pain of episiotomy.
Meclofenamate sodium, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, was compared at two dose levels (100 mg and 200 mg) with codeine (60 mg) and placebo in a double-blind, randomized study of 218 women after normal vaginal delivery. The purpose was to determine the analgesic efficacy and safety of meclofenamate sodium for the short-term treatment of acute episiotomy pain. Meclofenamate sodium was significantly better than placebo in most measures of pain relief and reduction of pain intensity. The 100-mg dose of meclofenamate sodium was significantly better than codeine in relieving pain. Adverse experiences with the study medications were minimal (6.4%). Patients receiving codeine reported more side effects than did those receiving either dose of meclofenamate sodium. Meclofenamate sodium is a safe, effective analgesic for acute episiotomy pain.
