A comparison of the cost-effectiveness of five strategies for the prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal toxicity: a systematic review with economic modelling
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that misoprostol, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and possibly proton-pump inhibitors, reduce the risk of symptomatic ulcers; misoprostol is less well tolerated than proton-pump inhibitors or COX-2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and proton-pump inhibitors reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms, but not serious gastrointestinal complications, compared with COX-2 NSAIDs. The authors' conclusions seem reliable.
