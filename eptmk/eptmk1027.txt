The hemostatic effect of tranexamic acid in conisatio colli uteri.
To evaluate the inhibitory effect of tranexamic acid (AMCA) on increased fibrinolyctical activity in connection with conisatio colli uteri we have carried out a randomized, double-blind study with patients operated upon partly with an open method of operation (80 patients) and partly with modified Sturmdorff sutures (150 patients). In connection with the open method the frequency of late bleeding decreased from 17.5% to 2.5%, which is significant. The corresponding decrease in connection with the other method was from 10.7% to 4.1%. This material was not sufficiently large to verify significance. The side effects of the prophylactic treatment with AMCA were few. The study indicates that AMCA affords good protection against late bleeding in conisatio colli uteri.
