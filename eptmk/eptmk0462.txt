Diagnosis of appendicitis in adults by ultrasonography or computed tomography: a systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the accuracy of ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing appendicitis in adults. The authors concluded that evidence suggests that CT is a sensitive and specific diagnostic test, but its routine use cannot be supported. The lack of reporting of review methods and the inclusion of generally poor-quality studies mean that the conclusions may be overstated.
