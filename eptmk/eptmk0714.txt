Immediate outcomes of substance use treatment within a state psychiatric hospital.
Outcomes of an integrated inpatient treatment program for persons with serious mental illness and substance use disorders are examined in relationship to five stages of treatment--stabilization, engagement, persuasion/awareness, active treatment, and relapse prevention. The study used a randomized design with participants assigned to an integrated mental health and substance abuse treatment program or standard psychiatric hospital treatment. At discharge, participants in the integrated treatment program indicated more active engagement in treatment and greater awareness of mental health issues, substance use issues, and the 12-step program than those who received standard hospital treatment. Participants in the integrated treatment program also saw their treatment as being more effective and had more motivation to stay healthy and sober. The integrated treatment program was not equally effective at each treatment stage with all participants. The implications of the program's success overall and at each treatment stage are discussed.
