Enamel opacities and dental caries in children who used a low fluoride toothpaste between 2 and 5 years of age.
A recent clinical trial investigated the cariostatic effectiveness of a low (550 ppm) fluoride toothpaste in comparison with a standard (1050 ppm) control paste in pre-school children who were 2-years-old at the start of the 3-year trial. The present study has investigated the prevalence of enamel opacities in permanent incisor teeth and of caries in children who had taken part. As well as children from test and control groups, a third group of non-trial children were included in the sample. A total of 1,523 children were examined in schools and had photographs taken of their upper permanent incisor teeth. The latter were scored using the Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF) index for fluorosis and the modified Developmental Defects of Enamel (DDE) index. Differences between the groups were small in real terms but using the TF index the child and tooth prevalence of opacities were significantly lower in the children who had used the test paste with a lower fluoride content; the same trend was seen in diffuse defects scored using the modified DDE index. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of caries in either primary or permanent teeth although the trend in both cases was for slightly more disease in children who had used the test paste.
