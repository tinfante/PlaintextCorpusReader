Effectiveness and safety of ritodrine hydrochloride for the treatment of preterm labour: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The review assessed the effectiveness and safety of ritodrine hydrochloride in delaying delivery and decreasing the incidence of pre-term birth. Ritodrine may be useful for the short-term prolongation of pregnancy, but the high incidence of adverse reactions means that administration should be limited. The authors' conclusions reflect the evidence presented but the studies may be of poor quality.
