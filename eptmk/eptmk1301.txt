Comparative trial of a two-dosage schedule of ketoconazole 2% cream for the treatment of tinea pedis.
Sixty-two patients with mycologically confirmed tinea pedis received two different treatment regimens of ketoconazole 2% cream on a randomized double-blind basis for 1 month with weekly evaluations. A 4-week posttreatment follow-up permitted an assessment of recurrence or improvement. After 1 month of treatment, 90% of the patients treated once daily responded clinically, in comparison with 83% of those treated twice daily. The cure rate was 63% for the once-daily and 60% for the twice-daily group. This rate substantially improved at follow-up (77% and 73%, respectively). One patient from each group discontinued therapy for an adverse reaction. On the basis of both clinical and mycologic assessments, topical treatment with ketoconazole 2% cream was effective as a once-daily therapy.
