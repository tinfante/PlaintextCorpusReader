Comparison of pregnancy-specific interventions to a traditional treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant women.
Alcohol and drug use in pregnancy is a significant concern. There is a paucity of treatment programs for substance-abusing pregnant women, especially if indigent. Furthermore, treatment retention is compromised when the drug of choice is crack-cocaine. This paper reports the results of a study comparing treatment retention of cocaine-abusing indigent pregnant women before and after incorporating pregnancy-specific interventions. Audits were performed on 603 charts of women enrolled between 1988 and 1994 in either a traditional treatment program (n = 114) or in the Pregnancy Substance Abuse Program (PSAP) (n = 489). Differences in treatment retention were found between the two treatment groups. Drop-out rates from the inpatient component of treatment were significantly lower in the PSAP group than in the control group (11.3% vs. 38.6%, p < .001). There was a higher rate of completion of outpatient treatment in the PSAP compared to the control group (34.4% vs. 13.5%, p < .005). These results were achieved with a 2-day decreased inpatient stay. Treatment retention improved when specialized interventions were provided, at minimal additional cost. These results have implications for other publicly funded treatment programs.
