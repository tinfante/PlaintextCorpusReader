Foot care: knowledge retention and self-care practices.
This study investigated the effectiveness of a "hands-on" foot care teaching/learning approach for adults with diabetes. By random assignment, the control group received a lecture presentation on foot care, while the experimental group participated in a hands-on session on foot care in addition to the lecture presentation. Data concerning the subjects' foot care knowledge and skills, the condition of their feet, and their level of HbA1c were gathered prior to and six months after the foot care educational sessions. No significant increases in knowledge about foot care were observed in the experimental group. The experimental group reported improvements in inspecting and washing their feet on a daily basis, and in care of the toenails. No significant differences were observed in the status of the subjects' feet. The HbA1c readings were significantly improved for both the experimental (t = 4.10, df = 10, p = 0.002) and control (t = 2.25, df = 9, p = 0.051) groups. A hands-on educational session may improve foot care practices temporarily. However, long term effects need to be studied to discern overall improvement of foot care practices and physical status of the feet.
