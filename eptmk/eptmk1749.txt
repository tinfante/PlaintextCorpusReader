The incidence of thromboembolism in the surgical intensive care unit.
The clinical diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unreliable. Studies have been performed examining the utility of frequent duplex scans. However, these studies included patients outside of the intensive care unit. The incidence of venous thromboembolism and the effect of a less intense surveillance protocol was prospectively examined at a level-1 urban trauma center for a 6 month period. During the study period there were 726 admission to the surgical intensive care unit. Sequential compression devices (SCDs) were used for DVT prophylaxis in 93 per cent of the admissions. A total of 114 duplex scans were ordered: 42 per cent for surveillance and the rest for evaluation of a clinical indication. Twelve DVTs were discovered (11% overall DVT rate). No patient on subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin developed a DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Four patients suffered a PE; however, none were found to have a lower extremity DVT on duplex ultrasound and all received SCD prophylaxis. Overall, proper use of DVT prophylaxis for intensive care unit days 1-14 was 77 per cent. The incidence of venous thromboembolism in a group of patients at overall high risk was low. A program of DVT surveillance with duplex ultrasound was not cost-effective.
