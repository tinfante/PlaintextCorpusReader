Overview of London trial of intramuscular interferon-beta Ia in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis.
This short monograph describes the rationale, design and outcome of a pilot study of beta interferon in patients with primary progressive MS. A total of 50 patients were studied for 2 years using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design. There was an emphasis on using MRI measures to evaluate outcome. The study showed that with the numbers studied, useful data could be obtained on safety and on efficacy on certain MRI measures. A larger study would be required to evaluate treatment on disability in this patient cohort and further work is needed to elucidate the relationship between quantitative MR and clinical measures over the longer term.
