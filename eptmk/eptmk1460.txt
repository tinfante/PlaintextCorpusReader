Neurothrombectomy devices for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: state of the evidence
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that neurothrombectomy devices were interesting treatment options for patients with acute ischaemic stroke, but there was a lack of high-quality research, especially on their comparative effectiveness. Despite potential bias in the selection of studies, the authors' conclusion reflects the evidence presented and is likely to be reliable.
