Single-drug versus combination empirical therapy for gram-negative bacillary infections in febrile cancer patients with and without granulocytopenia.
Empirical therapy with cefoperazone was compared with cefoperazone plus amikacin in granulocytopenic and nongranulocytopenic febrile patients. In nonneutropenic patients the overall response rate to cefoperazone was 88%; 10 of 12 gram-negative bacteremic patients were cured. Cefoperazone plus amikacin resulted in an 88% overall response rate and cured 14 of 15 patients with bacteremia. In neutropenic patients the overall response rate was 77% with cefoperazone alone and 73% with cefoperazone plus amikacin; the cure rates for gram-negative bacteremias were 8 of 11 and 6 of 12 patients, respectively. Our findings support the concept of single-drug empirical therapy with cefoperazone in febrile cancer patients, whether granulocytopenic or not, especially when gram-negative bacteremias are predominantly caused by Escherichia coli or Klebsiella species. The issue of Pseudomonas spp. and other more resistant pathogens needs further assessment with a larger number of patients.
