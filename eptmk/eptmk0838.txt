Radiculography: is routine bed rest really necessary?
After undergoing metrizamide radiculography, 119 patients were randomly allocated to two groups, one group remaining ambulant and the other being kept in bed for 24 h. A member of staff who did not know the category allocation questioned each patient regarding the occurrence of side-effects 24 and 48 h after the procedure. It was found that the incidence and severity of complications was neither increased nor decreased by allowing the patient to remain ambulant.
