Symptomatic treatment of migraine in children: a systematic review of medication trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of symptomatic treatment of migraine in children. The authors' conclusion that acetaminophen, ibuprofen and nasal sumatriptan are all effective treatments for migraine episodes in children may be overstated, as most treatments have only been tested in one or two small trials and some of the analysis might not have been entirely appropriate.
