[Prevention of vascular thromboses after renal transplantation using low molecular weight heparin]
Vascular thrombosis is one of the main causes of early transplant failure in pediatric patients. This paper reports the results of an open trial of the low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparine) used to prevent renal graft thrombosis in pediatric recipients with risk factors including donor or recipient age under 5 years, multiple arteries supplying the transplant, and positive history for recurrent thrombosis. During 1989, 42 of 67 children given a renal transplant were prophylactically treated with Enoxaparin. Only one transplant was lost to thrombosis among treated patients (1.5%), versus 9 transplants among 73 (12%) children who received their kidney in 1988 without prophylactic Enoxaparin. Risk factors were comparable in both groups of recipients. Enoxaparine therapy was associated with an increased rate of bleeding (12/42) without severe consequences. In conclusion, Enoxaparin is effective in preventing renal graft thrombosis. Availability of this prophylactic therapy makes it possible to use transplants removed from the youngest donors considered as inadequate by some groups.
