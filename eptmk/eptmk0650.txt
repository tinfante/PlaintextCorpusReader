Effect of vitamin A therapy on serologic responses and viral load changes after influenza vaccination in children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
Vitamin A administered to children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus before influenza vaccination in a double-blind randomized study did not enhance vaccine serologic responses but did dampen the increase in the human immunodeficiency virus viral load 14 days after immunization (vitamin A, decrease of 0.13 +/- 0.09 log(10) copies/mL; placebo, increase of 0.14 +/- 0.08, P =.02).
