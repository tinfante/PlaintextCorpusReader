Supplement feeds and nitrogen and calorie balance following femoral neck fracture.
A 10 day study of nitrogen and calorie balance has been undertaken in 61 women patients aged 65-96 years (mean age 81 years) with femoral neck fractures. All underwent fracture surgery with an inhalation anaesthetic lasting from 45 min to 2 h. Intake of ward food varied widely but was always low with a mean of 127 mg N kg-1 and 17 kcal kg-1 daily. Daily nitrogen production was 85-250 mg N kg-1 (mean 158 mg N kg-1) and calorie expenditure was 17-48 kcal kg-1 (mean 32 kcal kg-1). These were greatest in trochanteric fracture patients. Of the 61 patients, 90 per cent were in negative nitrogen balance with a mean 8 day deficit of 411 mg N kg-1 and all in negative calorie balance, mean 141 kcal kg-1. The deficits were greatest in trochanteric fracture patients. Sip feeding with supplementary enriched drinks raised protein and calorie intake substantially. Both nitrogen and calorie balance were significantly improved, but large calorie deficits remained; intolerance of the supplements proved to be a handicap in correcting the deficits in many patients.
