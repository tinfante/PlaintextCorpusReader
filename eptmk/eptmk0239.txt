Renin-angiotensin system inhibition prevents type 2 diabetes mellitus - part 1: a meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effects of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition on the development of type 2 diabetes in patients with arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure. The author concluded that RAS inhibition may help prevent type 2 diabetes. Given the lack of a quality assessment and the insufficient reporting of the review methods, the reliability of the author's conclusions cannot be adequately assessed.
