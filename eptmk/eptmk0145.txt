An overview of research on increasing indices of happiness of people with severe/profound intellectual and multiple disabilities
CRD SUMMARY: This review found that interventions were associated with improvements in indices of happiness in most, but not all, participants with severe/profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, but further research is required. Inadequate reporting of review methods and a reliance upon potentially-biased small observational studies mean that the authors' conclusions about the effects of the interventions may not be reliable.
