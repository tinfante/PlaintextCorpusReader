Use of emergency contraception by women as a back-up method
No normal contraceptive method is cent per cent reliable and efficacious. Therefore, the need for emergency contraception as a back-up method to prevent unwanted pregnancy
following failure of regular contraceptives like, missed OCPs, expelled lUCDs or slipped condoms has more relevance. The existing awareness of the common people about EC methods is very low. The present study has been designed to evaluate the use and misuse of emergency contraceptives among women who are adopting condom as their primary contraceptive method. The study results demonstrated that subjects, once properly counseled, would not like to misuse the emergency contraceptive even if it is available in advance.
