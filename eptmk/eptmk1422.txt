Efficacy of antidepressant medication among HIV-positive individuals with depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This well-conducted review concluded that antidepressant medication is efficacious in treating depression in out-patient men who are positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The authors noted that women and ethnic minorities were under-represented in the included studies, so the findings cannot be generalised to all depressed individuals who are HIV-positive. These conclusions are likely to be reliable.
