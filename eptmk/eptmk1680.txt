Neonatal signs after late in utero exposure to serotonin reuptake inhibitors: literature review and implications for clinical applications
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the adverse effects on infants of in utero exposure to serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SRIs) during the last trimester of pregnancy. The authors concluded that SRI exposure may result in a mild, self-limited neonatal behavioural syndrome. The conclusions are reasonable, although there were some methodological weaknesses in the conduct of the review.
