St. John's Wort and the treatment of mild to moderate depression: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: The review concluded that St. John's Wort was effective for the treatment of mild to moderate depression in comparison with placebo and equivalent to taking pharmaceutical antidepressants. However, the small sample sizes, variations between studies and failure to report levels of statistical significance mean that the results may not be reliable.
