Psychological and psychosocial interventions after attempted suicide: an overview of treatment studies.
A literature search was conducted to collect randomized controlled studies evaluating the outcome of psychological and psychosocial interventions after attempted suicide and deliberate self-harm. Twenty-five studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. The studies are grouped according to the psychological approach chosen for the intervention. They are discussed with regard to both the various therapeutic strategies and models used, and the repetition of self-harming behavior as the main outcome.
