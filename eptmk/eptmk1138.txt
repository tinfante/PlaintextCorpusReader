Study of tetanus neonatorum in Tanta Fever Hospital, 1988-1989.
Neonatal tetanus (NT) is the most under-reported fatal infectious disease. Ministry of Health statistics in Egypt reflect only 10% of NT cases. This study aims at evaluating the effect of the campaign to immunize pregnant women against tetanus in Gharbia governorate in Egypt. In this report it is shown that NT admission decreased sharply in 1989, compared to the previous years, and that the severity of the disease was also less. The value of a sentinel site is also demonstrated. To eliminate NT, however, educational programmes and better perinatal care are needed in addition to vaccination.
