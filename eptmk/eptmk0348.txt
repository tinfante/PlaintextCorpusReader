Noninvasive staging of non-small cell lung cancer: a review of the current evidence
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the performance of noninvasive techniques used to stage non-small cell lung cancer. Positron emission tomography was more accurate than computed tomography or endoscopic ultrasound for detecting mediastinal metastases. The review has a number of methodological limitations meaning that the authors' conclusions should be interpreted with caution.
