Spinal cord stimulation for complex regional pain syndrome: a systematic review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness literature and assessment of prognostic factors
CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that spinal cord stimulation is effective for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I (high-quality evidence) and type II (low-quality evidence). The reliability of these conclusions is unclear because the supporting evidence was limited, even for CRPS type I.
