Dopexamine and its role in the protection of hepatosplanchnic and renal perfusion in high-risk surgical and critically ill patients
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effects of dopexamine on hepatosplanchnic and renal perfusion in high-risk and critically ill patients. The authors concluded that evidence on dopexamine was inconsistent and inadequate. The evidence presented appears to support the authors' conclusions. However, the lack of reporting of methodological aspects of the review makes it difficult to assess the strength of the conclusions.
