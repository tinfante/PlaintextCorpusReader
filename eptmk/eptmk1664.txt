Low-dose aspirin in patients with stable cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that low-dose aspirin therapy reduced the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with stable cardiovascular disease, but increased the risk of severe bleeding. The authors' conclusion reflected the evidence presented, but poor reporting of the review methods and potential for language bias made the reliability of the authors' conclusion unclear.
