The work of a community mental health team for the elderly: referrals, caseloads, contact history and outcomes
A random sample of 120 open cases on the caseloads of two community mental health teams for elderly people, operating an open access policy, were followed up over 18 months. In comparison with referrals, caseloads had a higher proportion of patients with affective disorders and fewer with organic syndromes. Elderly patients with diagnoses of organic disorders tended to receive shorter episodes of intervention, more associated with assessment and diagnosis than continuing support, compared with those with affective disorders. A follow-up of those patients who were living at home at the point of sampling indicated that a higher proportion of those with affective disorders remained in their own homes compared with those with organic disorders.
