Surgical or medical management of subperiosteal orbital abscess in children: a critical appraisal of the literature
CRD SUMMARY: The review found that antibiotics could be a first line of treatment for some children with subperiosteal orbital abscesses. Surgery was indicated for non-medial abscesses and patients with loss of visual acuity. Potential for biases in the review process and the low quality of the included studies mean that the authors' conclusion should be viewed with caution.
