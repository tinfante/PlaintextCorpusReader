Experience with two different medicated intrauterine devices: a comparative study of the Progestasert and Nova-T.
A comparative study of the Progestasert (UPS) and the Nova-T in 326 randomly selected women was carried out. The observation period was 1 year. The over-all continuation rates for the two types of intrauterine devices (IUDs) were similar. The expulsion rate for the Nova-T (9.2%) was considerably higher (P = 0.001) than that for the UPS (1.2%). Medical removals for bleeding/pain were more frequent (P = 0.028) for the UPS (15.4%) as compared with the Nova-T (6.1%). The pregnancy rate for the UPS (Pearl index = 4.8) was insignificantly higher than that for the Nova-T (Pearl index = 2.8). Two of the pregnancies in the UPS group were ectopic. No significant changes in the reactive immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, or IgM) were observed in either of the groups. Our results indicate that neither of these two IUDs is preferable to the already existing medicated IUDs, such as the Copper T or the Copper 7.
