Experience with streptokinase treatment of major pulmonary embolism.
The efficacy of streptokinase was studied in an open trial on 30 consecutive patients with major pulmonary embolism, affecting at least three lobar arteries in pulmonary angiography. Streptokinase was started on average 26 hours from the onset of symptoms and usually given directly to the pulmonary artery. Conventional dosage was used and adjusted by thrombin time. The average treatment period was 32 hours. 26 patients (87%) survived and made a good clinical recovery. Improvement occurred early: signs of improved pulmonary perfusion appeared usually within four hours. Repeat angiograms in 20 patients showed remarkable increase in pulmonary perfusion and partial but not complete lysis of the emboli. Four patients (13%) died, three of them because of no response and one due to late cardiac arrhythmia. Bleeding requiring blood transfusion occurred in four patients, but caused no late sequelae. It is concluded that streptokinase treatment of major pulmonary embolism is effective and safe in rapidly restoring pulmonary perfusion.
