[Tactics of infusion therapy in the acute period of intracranial hemorrhages]
The paper deals with the determination of infusion therapy tactics in critically ill patients with intracranial hemorrhages on the basis of invasive measurements of systemic hemodynamics. The routine hemodynamic parameters (blood and central venous pressures, heart rate) are noted to fail to assess the volemic status of the patients in full. Unlike the use of colloidal solutions, infusion therapy with physiological sodium chloride is not shown to correct systemic hemodynamics. It has been ascertained that in acute intracranial hemorrhages, infusion therapy with crystalloidal solutions leads to impaired pulmonary gas exchange and increased pulmonary extravascular fluid and the use of a combination of crystalloidal solutions and a colloidal agent in a 1:1 ratio can correct the volemic status of the patients and is not followed by lung dysfunctions.
