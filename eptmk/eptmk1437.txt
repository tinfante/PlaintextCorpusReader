Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant systemic treatment in breast cancer: a meta-analysis
CRD SUMMARY: This review compared pre-operative (neoadjuvant) systemic therapy with post-operative (adjuvant) therapy for breast cancer using the same regimen. The authors concluded that neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy appear equivalent in terms of survival and overall disease progression, but neoadjuvant therapy is associated with an increased risk of loco-regional recurrence when radiotherapy is used without surgery. The poor quality of the included studies may limit the reliability of these conclusions.
