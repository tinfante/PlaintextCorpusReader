Systematic review evaluating the timing of thoracic radiation therapy in combined modality therapy for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated the effects of the timing of radiation therapy on survival in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer. The authors concluded that there is evidence that early radiation therapy is beneficial for overall survival when hyperfractionated radiation therapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy are used. Given the uncertain quality of the included studies, the authors' conclusions should be interpreted with caution.
