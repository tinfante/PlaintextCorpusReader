Visual internal urethrotomy. A prospective controlled trial comparing the results after 3 versus 28 days of postoperative catheterisation.
In a randomized trial, treatment of urethral stricture by direct visual internal urethrotomy with 3 days of postoperative catheterisation was found to be sufficient, given minimal complications, and had a cure rate of 85% after 6 months and 80% after 1 year follow-up. The postoperative follow-up should not include urethrography, but patient's statement and maximal urinary flow rate might be adequate.
