Open versus endovascular stent graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms: a meta-analysis of randomized trials
CRD SUMMARY: The review concluded that all-cause perioperative mortality and aneurysm-related mortality at short- and intermediate-term follow-up were lower following endovascular repair compared with open surgical repair in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. The authors' conclusions appear reasonable and are likely to be reliable.
