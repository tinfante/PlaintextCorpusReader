Post-abortion insertion of MLCu 250 and MLCu 375--a comparative trial.
This randomized prospective trial compared the use effectiveness and side effects of the MLCu 250 and MLCu 375 inserted immediately post-abortion. Five-hundred-and-forty-nine patients were followed-up over a two-year period involving 9890 woman-months of use with a loss to follow-up rate of only 5.1%. Both IUDs gave good protection against pregnancy (gross rates at 24 months, 1.8 and 2.1). There were no significant differences between the two devices in pregnancies or other termination events.
