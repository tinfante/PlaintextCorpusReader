Postoperative mental impairment in hip fracture patients. A randomized study of reorientation measures in 223 patients.
Mental impairment is a common and serious complication in geriatric surgery. We studied 223 hip fracture patients. They were over 64 years of age (mean 81), with no history of mental deterioration and acutely admitted to hospital from independent living conditions. They were randomized into two groups. One of these was subjected to reorientation measures during the perioperative phase, i.e., presurgery admission to the orthopedic ward, accompanied home visits during the hospital stay and access to reorientation devices--they received a large clock, calendar, radio, TV-set, telephone and were encouraged to wear their own clothing. Otherwise, there were no differences in the treatment given to the two groups. We used monitoring of cognitive function with the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and a feedback program for evaluation of the treatment results. There was a low incidence of postoperative cognitive deterioration in both groups, compared with historical controls. However, no difference in mental status was noted when we compared the two groups. The conclusion is that attributes were less important than the psychological environment for postoperative mental deterioration. The mean total continuous hospitalization (transfers between departments and hospitals included) in the reorientation group was 22 (95% CI: 17-43) days, the corresponding figures for the controls were 30 (14-29) days.
