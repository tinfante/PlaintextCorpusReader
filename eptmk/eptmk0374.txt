Glutamine-antioxidant supplementation increases body cell mass in AIDS patients with weight loss: a randomized, double-blind controlled trial.
Loss of body cell mass, the active functioning tissue of the body, commonly occurs in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and the extent of wasting is related to the length of survival. We evaluated the anabolic role of the amino acid L-glutamine (GLN) and antioxidants in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 26 patients with > 5% weight loss since disease onset. Subjects received GLN-antioxidants (40 g/d) in divided doses or glycine (40 g/d) as the placebo for 12 wk. Throughout the study, the subjects were seen weekly by a nutritionist, and body weight, bioelectric impedance assessment, and nutritional counseling were performed. Twenty-one subjects completed the study, and the groups were well matched. The 5 patients excluded from analysis all met a priori exclusion criteria. Over 3 mo, the GLN-antioxidant group gained 2.2 kg in body weight (3.2%), whereas the control group gained 0.3 kg (0.4%, P = 0.04 for difference between groups). The GLN-antioxidant group gained 1.8 kg in body cell mass, whereas the control group gained 0.4 kg (P = 0.007). Intracellular water increased in the GLN-antioxidant group but not in the control group. In conclusion, GLN-antioxidant nutrient supplementation can increase body weight, body cell mass, and intracellular water when compared with placebo supplementation. GLN-antioxidant supplementation provides a highly cost-effective therapy for the rehabilitation of HIV+ patients with weight loss.
