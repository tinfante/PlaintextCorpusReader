Medicated versus saline nose drops in the management of upper respiratory infection.
Seventy-four children from three weeks to two years of age with various upper respiratory symptoms were randomly assigned to three groups: two intervention groups (saline nose drops; medicated nose drops) and a control group (no nose drops). Forty-six children returned for check-up two days later. Subjects in all three groups improved between first and second contact. There was no significant difference between the three groups. It is concluded that medicated nose drops are not essential in the treatment of upper respiratory infection and rhinitis.
