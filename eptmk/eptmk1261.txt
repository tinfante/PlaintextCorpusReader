Low-dose oral misoprostol for induction of labor: a systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effects of low-dose oral misoprostol compared with dinoprostone, vaginal misoprostol and oxytocin for labour induction in women with a viable foetus and found it to be at least as effective as both vaginal misoprostol and vaginal dinoprostone. Although aspects of the review were unclear, it was of a sufficient standard and the conclusion may be reliable.
