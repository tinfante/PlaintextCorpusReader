Prophylactic respiratory physiotherapy after cardiac surgery: systematic review
CRD SUMMARY: This well-conducted review assessed the effect of respiratory physiotherapy on preventing pulmonary complications following cardiac surgery. The authors concluded that the usefulness of respiratory physiotherapy following cardiac surgery remains unproven, that the quality of existing trials is low, and that large-scale trials with a no-intervention control group are needed.
