The "relative" efficacy of involving family in psychosocial interventions for chronic illness: are there added benefits to patients and family members?
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effectiveness of family psychosocial interventions for chronic illness. The author concluded that family psychosocial interventions generally appear promising, but more research is required. The poor reporting of review methods and study quality make it difficult to comment on the strength of the evidence underpinning the author's conclusions.
