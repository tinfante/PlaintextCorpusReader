The efficacy of a broad-spectrum sunscreen in the treatment of melasma.
A double-blind study comparing a broad-spectrum sunscreen agent with its vehicle in the treatment of melasma was performed in fifty-three patients who were concomitantly using a depigmentating solution. In this study, 96.2 percent of those who used the sunscreen agent showed improvement as compared with 80.7 percent of those who used placebo. These results confirm the positive role of sun protection in the treatment of melasma and also establish hydroquinone as a major therapeutic agent in pigmentary disorders.
