Fluvoxamine in the treatment of depressive illness. A series of double-blind hospital based comparative studies carried out in the UK.
A series of double-blind hospital based studies comparing fluvoxamine with other antidepressants in depressed patients is reviewed. Overall there were no significant differences in terms of efficacy between fluvoxamine and the comparators (amitriptyline, dothiepin, lofepramine and mianserin). Fluvoxamine was shown to be associated with a low incidence of anticholinergic, cardiovascular or sedative effects. This profile of activity, together with low toxicity in overdosage, has established the place of fluvoxamine in the treatment of depressive illness.
