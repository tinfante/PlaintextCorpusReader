CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine for the treatment of unresectable or advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors concluded that gemcitabine should be offered as treatment for advanced or unresectable pancreatic cancer. Given the poor reporting of the review process and uncertain quality of the primary studies, the authors' conclusions should be viewed with some caution.
