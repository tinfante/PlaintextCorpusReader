Cognitive behaviour therapy within acute mental health care: a critical appraisal
CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated evidence for the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in acute mental health care settings. Only a small number of studies evaluating different forms of CBT were included. The conclusion that further research was needed seems appropriate but, due to limited reporting of the review methods, the possibility that relevant research was missed cannot be ruled out.
