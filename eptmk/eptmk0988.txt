CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that all pharmacological agents assessed were effective in prevention of any kind of mood episode, but different efficacy profiles were found for prevention of manic and/or depressive relapses. The reliability of the conclusions is uncertain given the potential for publication bias, risk of reviewer error and bias and unclear study quality.
