Effectiveness of sensory and motor rehabilitation of the upper limb following the principles of neuroplasticity: patients stable poststroke.
Based on the principles of neuroplasticity, the purpose of this crossover study was to determine if improvement in upper extremity (UE) function and independence could be achieved in patients 6 months to 7 years poststroke following an outpatient rehabilitation program (supervised 1.5 hours per week for 8 weeks reinforced with home gloving unaffected side and attended, graded, repetitive sensory and motor training activities). Twenty-one subjects (right or left hemiparesis; able to walk 100 feet with or without a cane; partially opened and closed the hand; partially elevated the shoulder and elbow against gravity) were randomly assigned to Group A (sensory training 4 weeks, motor training 4 weeks) or Group B (motor training 4 weeks, sensory training 4 weeks). Greater than 20% (P < 0.01) improvement was measured in functional independence and UE function (fine motor, sensory discrimination, and musculoskeletal performance). Gains were hemispheric and training specific and maintained over 3 months. This study provides evidence documenting significant improvement in function in the late poststroke recovery period following 12 hours of supervised learning based sensory motor training.
