Cica-Care gel sheeting in the management of hypertrophic scarring.
A prospective, controlled clinical trial was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of two types of silicone gel, Silastic Gel Sheeting (SGS) and Cica-Care (CC), in the management of hypertrophic scars. Forty-two patients were randomly assigned to SGS and CC groups and their hypertrophic scars were divided into treated and control areas. Extensometric measurements were made at monthly intervals for 6 months and significant improvement of the treated areas relative to the control areas was observed. The two gels were not significantly different in efficacy or safety, but CC, being more adhesive and more comfortable than SGS, has advantages in ease of use and patient acceptability.
