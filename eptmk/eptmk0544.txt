Double-blind investigation of R-42470 (terconazole cream 0.4%) and clotrimazole (cream 1%) for the topical treatment of mycotic vaginitis.
A total of 78 patients took part in a double-blind randomized comparison of the efficacy, acceptability and tolerance of a new antifungal terconazole (R-42470) (cream 0.4%) with the well established and clinically effective clotrimazole (cream 1%) for the topical treatment of mycotic vaginitis. Five grams of cream were applied to the vagina for 7 consecutive days. Twenty non-pregnant and 19 pregnant patients were included in each group. Clinical and mycological controls were carried out one week and one month after completion of therapy and 89.7% of the patients treated with terconazole responded to therapy and 82.1% patients treated with clotrimazole were cured. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference when the results of the terconazole treated patients and the clotrimazole group were compared.
