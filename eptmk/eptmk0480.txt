Efficacy of alosetron in irritable bowel syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
CRD SUMMARY: This review analysed six trials on the effects of alosetron in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The authors concluded that alosetron can improve symptoms or decrease pain in female IBS patients without constipation. However, they also concluded that alosetron can have adverse effects, particularly constipation. The effects in men are unclear. These conclusions are appropriate given the evidence available.
