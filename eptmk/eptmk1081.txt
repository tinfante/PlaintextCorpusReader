Studies on the effectiveness and safety of cilostazol, beraprost sodium, prostaglandin E1 for the treatment of intermittent claudication
CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed cilostazol, beraprost sodium and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) for treating intermittent claudication to improve walking distance. The authors concluded that cilostazol and PGE1 are effective, but further studies ofberaprost sodium are needed. A narrow literature search limits the reliability of these conclusions.
