Update on the use of corticosteroids in third molar surgery: systematic review of the literature.
OBJECTIVES: Third molar extraction produces inflammation, pain, and trismus, and different pharmacologic therapies have been evaluated for the minimization of postsurgical symptoms. The most frequently prescribed drugs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, followed by steroids and opiates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Cochrane using steroid and third molar as key words. RESULTS: The most relevant randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses (n = 28) were selected from among 72 articles. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of corticosteroids improves the postoperative experience of patients and has a significant impact on trismus and inflammation. Greater effects appear to be achieved by using the parenteral route and by administering the corticosteroid before the surgery.
